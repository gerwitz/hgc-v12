Henry Copeland (BlogAds) observation: "staid Midwestern brands" seem to have an easier time adopting podcasts than blogging... it's easier to broadcast than dialogue.  I agree, except I don't think this is a uniquely Midwestern experience.

[Jared Spool][1] was the only presenter that knows how to present.

Susan Chiu from [Octanti][2] reminds me of the grad students in the Psych department who joked about being paid to teach MBAs what they should have learned in school if they'd been paying attention.  I think she'd throw something at anyone who suggested in her presence that "clicks" have any intrinsic value.

Compared to software engineering conferences, this marketing-oriented one has a startling amount of beautiful people.  And sleazy ones; the exhibit hall feels like a used car lot.
