It seems a foregone conclusion that [RSS marketing is poised to take off][1].  I remain a bit skeptical about the uptake rate of Joe User to a brand new "not browsing, not email" medium.

Nonetheless, I believe it's inevitable.  Some [fun approaches][2] are surfacing, but perhaps more important are the more [mundane applications][3] that will introduce feeds to new audiences.

So, as the current email-dominated marketing industry gives up trying to elbow spammers aside and embraces "pull" marketing, [FeedBurner][4] is uniquely positioned to grow by leaps and bounds.  They only need to recognize the value they can provide to marketers-as-publishers rather than by selling space within other publishers' feeds before the email push vendors get there and add feed management to their portfolios.
