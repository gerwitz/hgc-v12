So, here I am at ad:tech.  We came in late to the keynote, but got to watch the second half of a dry, read-from-notes tour of one agency's "multicultural" promotions.  It was littered with meaningless results numbers, and punctuated with a slide touting the success a major campaign that primarily cited impressions.

Aren't impressions something you just buy?  Isn't this just marketing-industry bling, showing off how much money you spent?

Another gem, regarding CGM: you have to protect your brand, "you don't want people doing things they shouldn't."

I do hope the innovation coefficient goes up from here.
