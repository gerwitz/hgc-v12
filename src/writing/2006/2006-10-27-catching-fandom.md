![3 down, 1 to go](/media/2006-10-27-catching-fandom/3 Down.thumbnail.jpg)

The World Series has made me, at least temporarily, into a baseball fan.  Thanks to the generosity of my friend and employer, we got to experience game 4 last night 4 rows from the field.  It wasn't my first World Series game, but it was Kristan's, and her excitement (and Jason's, and that of the wild fan two rows down) was contagious.  I've found myself contemplating how weather delays could affect pitcher selection, which anyone who knows my regular season opinion of baseball will find highly amusing.
