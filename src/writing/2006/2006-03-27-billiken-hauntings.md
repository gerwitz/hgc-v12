I've spent most of my academic life surrounded by Billikens, at [University][1] and [high school][2].  It's easy to consider the fellow a Saint Louis phenomenon, but then he [pops up][3] in underground Seattle.

Researching a new digital camera, I was quite surprised to find him (even labeled) the centerpiece of a [demonstration picture in Japan][4].  Wikipedia is kind enough to explain: naturally Billiken is [enshrined throughout Japan][5].  Of course, the best summary of Billiken's life is found at a [toy museum in Arkansas][6].

Sometimes the whole planet seems too small.
