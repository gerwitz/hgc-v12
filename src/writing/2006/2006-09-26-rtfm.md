CONNECTING THE FM ANTENNA WIRE

The FM antenna comes pre-attached. If the antenna is disconnected, follow these steps to reconnect it:
>
>

>   1. Push the "F" connector plug on the end of the antenna wire into the receptacle on the Radio.
>

>   2. Straighten out the antenna to its full length.
>

>   3. Orient the wire for best reception. (The position for best reception is guaranteed by Murphy's Law to be wherever it looks the worst, like draped down over the front of the kitchen counter.)

Good stuff.
