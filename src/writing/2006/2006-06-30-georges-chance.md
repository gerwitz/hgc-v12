[Ullrich][1], [Basso][2] (Ivan?  Really?), [Sevilla][3] join Hamilton and almost every Spanish rider in [suspension][4] from their Tour de France teams, just before the start.  Even [Vinokourov][5] is suspect-by-association.

Sure narrows the field for [Hincapie][6] this year.  Here's hoping that the team supports him like they did Lance (that means you, Popovych).
