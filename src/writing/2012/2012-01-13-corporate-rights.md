In 1791, when the United States ratified the Bill of Rights, the population of "free white males of 16 years and upward" was 807,094. (The total population was more than 3 million more.)

I don't mean to draw any conclusions about the ascendancy of corporation as a governance institution, but do find it noteworthy that the scale of a single company's global manufacturing network is comparable to the birth of its nation.
