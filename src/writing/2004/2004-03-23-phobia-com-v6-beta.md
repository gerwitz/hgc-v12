In response to all the griping about my blog's dust collecting recently, I've forwarded phobia.com to my test Snip Snap instance.  The development instance (yeah, even my personal site is fully staged) has so many entries that haven't been published that they'll be relegated to archive obscurity by the time they're accessible.  Cope.
