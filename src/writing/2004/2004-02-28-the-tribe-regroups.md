First group ride of the season drew Bryce, Brett, Alex, Kris, Yonas, and Will.  The 20ish miles from my place to Chain of Rocks and back was a bit far for this early in the season, and poor Yonas has a mountain bike with a large chainring the same size as my small one.  I think he had to pedal 2 or 3 times as many revolutions for the same distance.
