title: Then they came for the teachers
---


Over the last year, I've seen several smart educators worrying generative AI will make homework obsolete, but they mostly express hope that this will mostly hasten adoption of the "flipped classroom" model. Now, [Ethan Mollick is [disappointed his colleagues are not adapting](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/post-apocalyptic-education).

Meanwhile, [Alan Jacobs bemoans his professorship being turned into a bullshit job](https://blog.ayjay.org/administrivia/).

It all seems rather predictable. Which is more likely in late capitalism: will we make a concerted effort at social change and modify our expectations of educators, or will we optimize the business of schooling until they are expendable?
