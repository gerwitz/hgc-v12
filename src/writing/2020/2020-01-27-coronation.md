Capping an otherwise [bad week](/weeks/2394/), Shannon and I joined the [Krewe of Freret](https://www.kreweoffreret.org/) for a coronation ball on Saturday. During which I was crowned [King Freret IX](https://mardigrasguide.com/royalty/).

I drank myself silly and don’t really remember much after the Queen’s preparty in the [Pontabla apartments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontalba_Buildings). I talked to her about the need for surgeons to have a functional level of psychopathy and she complained about how the computing metaphor holds us back from understanding the brian. Her family was incredibly gracious.

At the main party in the [Cabildo](https://louisianastatemuseum.org/museum/cabildo), the prior king relinquished his crown peacefully, I embarrassed myself dancing with Mr. City Council VP Jason Williams, and…that’s about all I remember. Shannon adulted me through the night, and while nothing can wash away grief it at least kept me from falling too far.
