Amsterdam has a [public registry of algorithms](https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/en/ai-register/) that is a very promising example of civic transparency and algorithm/AI accountability. Recorded here for posterity are the considerations listed in this catalog today (late 2020) and their descriptions:

Datasets
: Key data sources utilised in the development and use of the system, their content and utilisation methods.

Data processing
: The operational logic of the automatic data processing and reasoning performed by the system and the models used.
: This includes architecture overview, source code, and performance measurement.

Non-discrimination
: Promotion and realisation of equality in the use of the service.

Human oversight
: Human oversight during the use of the service.

Risks
: Risks related to the system and its use and their management methods.
