After [Shannon][1] and I [proposed][2] Bus Driver Appreciation Day, Bus Chick [picked it up][3] and [reminded everyone][4], and word spread from [Seattle][5] to [Virginia][6] and [DC][7].

We gave out four nice "merci beaucoup" [cards][8] with Starbucks gift cards.  All were well received, so we'll call this year a success and try publicizing more in 2010.
