Yesterday's 35 mile ride from Chain of Rocks to Alton wasn't enough abuse, so today we joined the Tour de Fat, a [Trailnet][1]-organized ride sponsored by the brewer of Fat Tire Ale.

I took the train to Forest Park, then chose the long loop to Chesterfield Parkway.  43 miles later, I am quite pre-sunburnt in preparation for the vacation to Florida.

Highlights:
- MetroLink driver holding the train for me
- Passing dozens during the log route leg, being passed by none
- The massive clicking sound of cleats dis/engaging pedals at stoplights
- Breaking the speed limit in a 35mph zone
