Before moving _[A Soldier of the Great War][1]_ from the bedside shelf to the "library," I want to log at least one memorable passage:

   [1]: http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0151836000

>"In a thousand years," Alessandro said, "this incident will be remembered.  By then, of course, we will have become angels, devils, or a dragon that breathes fire...but we have given this rock a story that will be passed on."
>"What good is that?"
>"It isn't to our advantage, if that's what you mean.  However, it's pleasurable to cast a line into the future, no matter how tenuously.  You never know, the line may be unbroken all the way to the last judgment."
