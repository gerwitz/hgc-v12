Recent dream scenes:

From the vantage of a camera placed atop a building, I view military convoys merging where two highway meets. Everything was orderly, of course, except where they had to dodge the 50-foot tortoise crossing the road.

And last night's waking dream was done in stop-motion animation.  The dream itself was of filmmaking; the subject was rather mundane and reminded me of a soap opera except, rather than human, all the characters were ottomans.  A diverse cast, mind you, in many shapes and sizes.
