I haven't seen a medical professional for routine soma maintenance in ages.  Part of the cause of this is the complexity involved. I need to see a dentist, an optometrist, an internist, an allergist, and probably a few other specialists after they enumerate for me ails I haven't noticed.

It would be far easier to motivate myself if there was a one-stop doctor shop where I could just plant myself in a bay and let the M.D.s filter through.
