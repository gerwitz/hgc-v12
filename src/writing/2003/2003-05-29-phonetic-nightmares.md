So I thought I had a plan.  I'd give in to the [Moveable Type][1] hegemony and sign up for [TypePad][2], then work on a simple tool that met my needs as a personal project, maybe to learn [Ruby][3] or [Cocoon][4].

   [4]: http://cocoon.apache.org/

Enter [blojsom][5].  Looks like it's time to dust off the [Cube][6].
