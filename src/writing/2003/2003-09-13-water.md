Moments ago I watched a neighbor grabbing a case of bottled water from his trunk (of his Volkswagen, to take up to his loft living the stereotype).  I thought idly to myself that I prefer the filtered water from my fridge to most bottled, but I do like having a bottle to carry about.  Hence, I need to find some bottled water that comes with a nice reusable package.

Minutes later I happen upon [Taylor's ode to Voss][1].  How serendipitous.
