[Kitchen K][1] opened today in the Merchandise Mart storefront, with the coolest address in St. Louis.  The space is dramatic without being distractingly trendy; the menu isn't extensive, but is eclectic, with a wide range of styles (and prices).  Finally, as expected of the founders of Hot Locust, the food is tasty and defies classification.  They're open until 10:00 (bar until 1:30) presently, but intend to extend those hours shortly.
