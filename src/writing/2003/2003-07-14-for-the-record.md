Sat: 35 miles
Metropolis Ride and then some The Riverfront Trail rest stop at the old Coast Guard building has a new Mary Meacham mural, and one of the Americorps volunteers there had some great stories of his days as a prizefighter (highlight: meeting Nelson Mandela while he was still imprisoned).

Sun: 48 miles
Trailnet Big Bottle ride.  Toughest Trailnet route I've done this year, even without considering the dirt road portion.
