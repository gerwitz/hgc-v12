The pizza ride last week was only 45 miles, but today I decided to try the Arch to Alton.  That is, the [Riverfront Trail][1] to the [Chain of
Rocks Bridge][2] over to the [MCT
Confluence][3] and [West
Alton][4] trails.  58 miles, 15 mph average.  Flat, but windy.  Lesson of the day?  20 mile rests are too far apart.
