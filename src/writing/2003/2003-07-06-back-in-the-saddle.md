First ride since the Tour de Cure, 45ish from Arnold to Forest Park and back.  The pace was easy, but the heat and the hills on Telegraph Road gave some good burn.  I couldn't figure out why I had a headache later in the day, before I realized I had consumed only two granola bars, a Milky Way, and some crackers.  So, pizza for dinner!

It's amusing that until recently I thought of my 24 pound [Trek 8000][1] as a lightweight bike, but now that my frame of reference has shifted to the world of 17 pound [road bikes][2], it seems quite heavy.
