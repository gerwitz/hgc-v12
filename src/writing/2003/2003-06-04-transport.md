With my Miata in the shop for routine service, I'm taking Metro today.  This time, I am empowered with a functional Powerbook battery and iPod.   My commute, from grabbing a mango chai at Farrago to walking through downtown crowds to waiting at stations and sitting on the train and the bus has been transformed from an idle chore to both and enjoyable and possibly the most productive part of my day.  Sweet.
