Very few things in life are as ego-inflating as driving home on a beautiful day after playing soccer, and finding a red Mustang convertible occupied by three attractive college-age women keeping pace with you so they can ask you to follow them at their exit.

Missed opportunity, perhaps, but the flattery of the request is likely much more gratifying than the experience gained through acceptance.  ;-)
