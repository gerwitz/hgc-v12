In 2005 I briefly anticipated Buro Vormkrijgers's [PONG CLOCK][1].  I later forgot about it.

But I just discovered John Maushammer's [Pong Watch][2] and have to have one.  The concept may not be original, but his design is inspired.  The minimalist prototype cases, PIC code that adapts to low battery levels, and aesthetic PCB layout all demonstrate enough perfectionism to ensure a quality build without paralyzing the builder.

I dropped Maushammer an email pleading for a copy, and he responded that he's looking into salable production.  I'm more excited than I could be if I ordered a mass-produced watch, because I can follow how he has thought about the build so carefully.  And that's how I define design: thoughtfulness applied to building.

(If I were writing fiction with a character that carefully designs small things, I don't think I could come up with a better name than Maushammer.)
