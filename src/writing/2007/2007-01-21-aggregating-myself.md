Apologies to readers subscribed via RSS or email (all 33 of you) for any spam recently with posts entitled "Daily Bookmarks".  I accidently live-tested a new feature I've hacked together, where a nightly process will automatically post the bookmarks I've saved during the day as a blog post.

I hope to offer a feed that does not include these auto-generated posts before I add more that include bike ride log summaries, weekly music charts, restaurant reviews, etc.
