Some quick thoughts from Seattle, WA:

People here aren't afraid of each other. Much of the "feel" of this city seems to grow from that foundation.

There is a taxidermied dog at the SAM, sitting on a chair in a fairly obscure corner.  A group of teenagers (from South Korea, I believe) streamed by it as they slithered through that corner to shortcut their tour.  Watching them, one by one, startle at the sight of the dog is one of the funniest things I've seen in some time.
