I've reviewed the performance of my investments over 2006, to see what I can learn for this year.  Aside from the loft, whose value is hard to measure until it's actually sold (but indications are rosy), the results are encouraging.

My IRA (40% of my investments) was up almost 15%, thanks largely to [FSIIX][1] and [AAPL][2].

The Roth IRA (5% of total) was down over 3%, due to [INTC][3], which I'm still holding.

Finally, the "cash" brokerage account rose 36%!  [AAPL][2], [SBUX][4], and [NTDOY][5] were very good to me.
