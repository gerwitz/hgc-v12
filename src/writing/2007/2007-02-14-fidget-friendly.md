I decided it was time for a wireless mouse, and decided to finally try one of those modern button-congested monstrosities, the [Logitech MX Revolution][1].  Most of it's superfluous buttons are easily ignored, and the scroll wheel can be set to spin freely, [perfect for fidgeting][2].

The OS X drivers, though, suck.  [Contrary to mainstream reviews][3], the software is [widely despised][4], and even [Logitech's own forums][5] are teeming with complaints.

Thankfully, there's [SteerMouse][6].  With the thumbwheel set to navigate through lists and trigger ExposÃƒÂ©, it's so pleasant to use I miss it when sitting on the couch using the MacBook's trackpad.
