It's an exciting day to be a Mac user and investor in Apple!  Today Steve Ballmer's company [pre-announced Office 2008 for Mac][1].  This includes such exciting, patent-protected innovations as [the Ribbon][2].  AAPL jumped 8.3%, enough that I could take the profit and buy 4 iMacs and still have enough for one of those phones I heard something about.
