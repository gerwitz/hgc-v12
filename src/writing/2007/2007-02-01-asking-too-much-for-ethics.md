> The UCI's threat to reduce the grand tours is the single biggest threat our sport has faced in years. And if they do it, it will be the nail in the coffin of a sport that was born out of the ashes of long-distance suffering. The very thing that makes our sport so popular will be destroyed.

From the [RBR][2] newsletter, on a proposal to shorten the tours of France, Italy and Spain from three weeks to two. The theory is that easier tours will mean riders are less likely to resort to doping.

I think Phil's engaging in a bit of hyperbole, but I agree with his point nonetheless.
