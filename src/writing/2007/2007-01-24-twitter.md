Back in the day, we used to leave a small file named `.plan` in our Unix home directories, which others could read over [port 79][1] with the [`finger`][2] command.  It was a useful for quick status updates, to find out what people were working on (or where they were off to) without pestering them.  [John Carmack][3] popularized it as a [proto-blog][4], and the IM phenomenon brought a similar function mainstream via presence notification with custom status messages.  But I've been frustrated at how difficult it is to log and broadcast a group's or even my own status messages.

Enter [Twitter][5], basically an implementation of finger using the contemporary infrastructure of HTML and RSS over HTTP, with IM and SMS tie-ins.  Now [I have a .plan][6] again.  Maybe someday [Ambient Devices][7] will build me an LED sign to display it in a more physical manner.
