Besides being a very happy [AAPL][1] investor, I've been accurately identified as [one of [them]][2]... those Apple fanboys that narrow our focus away from the company's competition, reading [MacRumors][3] rather than [/.][4].

What's frustrating is how the Apple fanboy label is used to dismiss my viewpoint, implying that my judgement is meritless, clouded by the [reality distortion field][5] and driven by a desire to belong.  As if I'm driven to identify with the cocksure slacker on the [Get a Mac][6] ads.

Perhaps "we" are simply impressed with Apple's comprehensive design.  Steve and his minions appreciate the value of [engineering][7] and understand that beauty is more than skin deep, that [design is concerned with function, not merely form][8].

It's a rare pleasure to use products that have been thoughtfully assembled with a coherent, consistent user experience.  It shouldn't be: [visual voicemail][9], [system-wide search][10], and [tangible interfaces][11] should be **obvious**.  If the rest of the electronics industry would just let go of [featuritis][12], maybe we could just learn to expect it and be less compelled to go [overboard with enthusiasm][13].
