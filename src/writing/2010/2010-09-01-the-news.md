A few gems of wisdom today from the morning news we wake up to:

  * Tony Blair went to war but couldn't have imagined it was going to be a [nightmare][1].

  * Some politician thinks No Child Left Behind is working because the curriculum kids have today is "much harder" than when he was a schoolchild.

  * Rodney Clark, owner of an [oyster poaching company][2], claims innocence because he "cannot control" the actions of other people just because he employs them.

NPR (or KUOW) by passed each of these along these as observations or sound bites without comment.  [Ira Glass is right][3] about broadcast journalism.
