I recently heard a [story on NPR][1] where Kate Zernike traced the origins of the Tea Party movement to a specific moment: a [protest at Westlake Plaza][2] in February, 2009.  About 200 people showed up.

[Our studio][3] overlooks Westlake Plaza and the building entrance makes it impossible to miss rallies, and they aren't uncommon.  But I remember this one: it was lunch on Presidents' Day and I was a bit annoyed at so many signs with anti-Obama messages that didn't really pick an issue.  It seemed to me a pointless, angry reaction the the [jubilance][4] of the election.  The crowd was also moreâ€¦rural than most.  There were overalls.

But I found my way around on my way to the [market][5] for food and only rolled my eyes.  In hindsight, I feel like I should have done something to stop them.  I was at the genesis of an epidemic and failed to notice.
