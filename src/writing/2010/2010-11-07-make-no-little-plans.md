> Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty.
> - Daniel H. Burnham, quoted in Charles Moore, [Daniel H. Burnham, Architect, Planner of Cities][1] (1921), v.2, [p.147][2]
