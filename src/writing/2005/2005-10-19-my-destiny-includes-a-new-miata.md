Yesterday I received a voucher from Mazda for $35 if I'd simply go test drive a [2006 Miata][1].

Then, on the way home, my clutch began behaving as if the hydraulics were low, and by the time I got home I couldn't use 1st gear and shifting at all was a chore.  Naturally, I got stuck in stop-and-go traffic for several miles.  It was **not** a moment of [jinba ittai][2].

Time to go call the contact who thought he might be able to extend an employee discount
