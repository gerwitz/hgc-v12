Today I met with the daughter [Colleen][1] and I gave up for adoption 12 years ago and her mother.  Friends and family seem to want some dramatic story out of the event, but there was a blessed lack of it; she's a normal 12 year old and her mom has been completely open with her.

She did have a lot of questions about her genetic heritage, which has prompted me to resume some [genealogy][2] research, and contemplate the meaning of [Nature, nurture, and self][3].
