a.k.a. [JavaServer Faces][1]

I have been highly skeptical of JSF, perceiving it as a "me too" answer to ASP.NET, in the same manner JSP was an answer to classic ASP.  My skepticism may prove insignificant, though, if the momentum behind JSF and credibility lent by some big-name supporters is any indication.  My hope is that, like JSP, it grows beyond this initial "we can do that, too" model and evolves to be better than the competitor that inspired it.  [Shale][2] offers a sign that this may come to pass.
