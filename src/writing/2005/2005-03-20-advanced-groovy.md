[NFJS 2005](gateway-software-symposium-2005.html)

I skipped the intro session, but attended [Rod Cope][1]'s second session on [Groovy][2].  His presentation was a strong collection of "look how easy this is" examples that made quite a compelling case for Groovy (or, arguably, any dynamic language with closures, dynamic extensions, etc.).  I am attracted to Groovy because it builds on the existing wealth of the Java ecosystem, is already adopted by [Snip Snap][3], and already has a great library of its own, including some great string templating tools.  Rod did a good job of making his case by example, without the Geary-style evangelizing.
