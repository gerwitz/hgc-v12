subtitle: Creating Next Generation Web Applications


[Ben Galbraith][1] presenting without his usual partner, [Dion Almaer][2].  I didn't learn anything new; it was largely an AJaX demo.  At least Ben is an entertaining speaker.  Perhaps their new site, [Ajaxian][4], will prove more educational over time.
