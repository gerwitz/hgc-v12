[Struts][1] is a web application framework for Java that grew out of discussions about applying MVC to web apps with Craig McClanahan on the tomcat-users mailing list.  I participated in many of the early design conversations as one of those pesky early adopters that adds to the TODO list but rarely provides a patch.

I also pushed for utilization of Struts on projects at work.  Fortunately, Struts adoption skyrocketed, and so we [ETT][2] members got a head start on the market with experience on Struts (and with MVC generally.)
