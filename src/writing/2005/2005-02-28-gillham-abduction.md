My great-great-great-great grandfather Samual Gillham was born in 1778 to James Gillham (himself the son of Thomas Gillham, a soldier in the American Revolution).  In 1790 James and his son Isaac were working in the field when Samual, his brother Clemons, one of their sisters and their mother Ann were kidnapped by Kickapoo Indians.

Clemons was only 4 when the kidnapping occurred.  When they were rescued in 1795, he could not speak English and did not want to leave the Indians.  The recorded story says Clemons "always acted like an Indian."
