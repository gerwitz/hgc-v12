My father gave me a [flying saucer][1] for my birthday.  The package pronounces it a perfect gift for your 32 year old child, but I guess he thought I'm mature enough to handle it.
Finally got it inflated and flying today.  This was a great gift; I'd never buy it for myself, but it's a ball to fly.
