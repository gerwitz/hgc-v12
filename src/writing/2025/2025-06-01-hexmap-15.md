Now that I can reliably send emails, it's time to give attention to the weekly report. I started by trying to make the dashboard represent the week so far. This involved wasting too much time trying to build SVG in the abstract, but I finally gave in to writing the XML as strings and will parse when I need to generate raster images.

Way too much time was lost getting LAEA projection to work, using the psuedo-center of cells, so a rendering of them is roughly regular. Otherwise Mercator-like projections cause very awkward skewing, and if I'm all-in on the hexagon, it needs to look like a hexagon.

The end result was a lovely set of hexes for the cells visited so far this week. When I render this for my own data including long bike rides, they get a bit small, though. And then when I look at a week ago when I took a train to Einhoven, they become little blobs. And when I go back farther to a week with both Amsterdam and Bengaluru cells, they are sub-pixel and the broswer doesn't even bother drawing anything.

So. Maybe I will use this code to draw "this cell in context" when describing visits to new cells. For now, though, I'm reverting to a bunch of dots that are scaled to the view rather than the coverage area.
