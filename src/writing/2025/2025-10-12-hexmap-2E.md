I let Github Copliot write code autonomously this week. It did fine. The first pass was a mess, but after I learned what kind of specifics to provide. The future is clearly at hand where you can define an issue and have it magically resolved. It's easy to imagine beyond that, with agents applying a charter to rank issues and proactively resolve problems and add features, and even run tests with users.

Shepherding them will still be a key human skill, but it's crazy how quickly this seems possible.

Anyway, this week Copilot added search. This includes alternative addressing schemes, so if you enter e.g. an India DIGIPIN you get the appropriate hex.
