Holidays mean back to work!

Starting Christmas Day I tried out Cursor by asking its agents to write documentation about the project (a lot of the architectual documentation had gotten a bit Kilo Code-specific). Mostly, my energy went into getting Cursor to work with my devcontainer setup.

Then I wrapped up the to-do list for code improvements; there are very few compiler warnings remaining and the web usage instrumentation layer is much simpler.
