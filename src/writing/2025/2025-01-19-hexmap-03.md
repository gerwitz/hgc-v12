It got real this week; there is a process that picks up data imported from Foursquare and maps it to H3 "visits". And they can be viewed on a map! That was much easier than expected, thanks to [H3J](https://github.com/INSPIDE/h3j-h3t).

This is still a small POC but it sure feels good to see hexagons on a map!
