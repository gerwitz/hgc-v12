Started on importing data from Foursquare, which has a simple API. I'm trying to generalize as much as I can, so future data sources are simple implementations.

This includes a data model. I'm using SQL because I'm comfortable with it, and want the ability to let the DB work for me on indicies, relations, counting

But I think I'll avoid fancy features for geometry or geography, because I don't want to depend on anything but boring SQL for deployment. Also, the lon/lat convention for postgres points is jsut too confusing and I don't want to live in Transposed World.

String IDs are okay for enums like sources. It can be tempting to assume ints are faster, but that doesn't seem to be the case in modern DB engines, and I think it makes errors less likely and certainly makes the data more human-readable
