More vibe-coding search tricks this week. I've been trying out OpenAI's Codex VS Code plugin (using the GPT 5 Codex model) but it loses the plot very quickly. Copilot has gotten a lot better since I last used it, and with Claude Haiku is quite competent. Kilo Code with either of those models is still best.

(Codex is much more productive on my site; it seems a lot more comfortable with a more mainstream tech stack than my bespoke Rust framework.)

Most interesting was how I found myself hand-coding example functions because it's more efficient to say "align with this" than to specify. This feels quite a bit different than the intern trope; compared to humans the coding agents make more dumb mistakes but often seem to have higher "reading comprehension". I've found, though, that asking them to document patterns before applying them is most effective, and in that way they feel like students, indeed.
