Nails set me up with a workspace that includes multiple crates. I can see some benefits to scaling this way, but it just makes things more complicated than they need to be. So I've reshuffled into a single crate.

Mostly this week I set up user CRUD and authentication via `axum_login` and got comfortable with editing the frontend. There's no real app here, but I feel like over the break I went from knowing nothing about Rust to being comfortably in a workflow.
