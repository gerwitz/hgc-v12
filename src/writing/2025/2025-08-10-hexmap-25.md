It's a little weird having actual users and no idea if they're logging in. But I don't want to add external analytics and try to figure out how to preserve privacy, so I added telemetry. As a nice side effect of DIY, the records associate with target objects without cluttering URLs with querystrings. And thanks to Claude, I was able to turn it into a proper Axum middleware layer with asynchronous write queuing, which I probably would not have prioritized if writing "alone".

There's also a more detailed and organized view of background service status in the admin interface because I feel responsible for things running smoothly for my large popularion of 8 users.
