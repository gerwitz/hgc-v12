Started the week with lots of layout tweaking and email edge case handling. But it got exciting when I decided to bring 3D back; although the deck.gl layer for H3 hexagons supports 3D, making the visualizations work nicely in 2D requires I have distince flat and 3D modes. Transitioning between them has been non-trivial, and I ended up asking Claude for a lot more debugging assistance than I'm used to. There will be a lot more dialing-in before I'm proud of it, but already it makes me happy to play with.
