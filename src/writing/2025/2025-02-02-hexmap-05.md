Parsing Strava data was easy to start with, but full of edge cases. I'm experimenting with a separate call to enhance records with more detailed data.

Along the way, I built a fancy browser of imported records, for my own diagnostic purposes but I'll probably keep it. As part of this, I've started using deck.gl rather than Maplibre GL alone.

I am definitely still a Rust noob. But someone on the tokio discord was very helpful in helping me convince Axum that it's okay for optional date parameters to be omitted from querystrings.
