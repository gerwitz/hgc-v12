Strava enhancement was more edge-casey than I thought, but seems to be working nicely. It's fast enough I've decided not to bother with user visability. (I was planning to celebrate enhancement and report on the changes to users, but those in practice those messages will come right after the activity is imported anyway, so why clutter?)

If I use this devlog to make public posts, this would be a good time to show some visuals, eh?
