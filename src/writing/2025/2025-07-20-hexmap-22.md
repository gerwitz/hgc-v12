This week was about collections, with a lot of time lost to gettng caching to be just-aggressive-enough. I feel pretty good about the state of it, though I'm not settled on the "levels" of public, personal, and private. I might fiddle a little more, or maybe should just wait to see what it's useful for (to me or others) before investing too much. I couldn't help myself but to enable Markdown in descriptions, though.

As a nice side effect, I finally put a proper user profile page in place. So /username isn't just the map. Moving the map to another URL made me want a static preview of it, and this was complicated! I leaned heavily on Gemini, who is better at reading Javascript than I, to get this done with minimal code duplication. At this point, I think the LLMs own most of the map rendering code, though it's all still recognizable as an evolution of my original implementation.

My new artificial interns and I also made a lot of improvements to error logging.
