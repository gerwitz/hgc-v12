It is amazing how much work[^work] it is to support an esoteric set of geo addressing schemes without bloating the codebase too much.

[^work]: By "work" I mean, of course, oversight of coding agents and feeding them the right documentation.

I also finally got around to some basic collection management (editing notes, removing hexes, etc.). This was pretty simple work given everything already in place, so I let Claude Haiku via Kilo Code give a go at user-facing UI for the first time. It did pretty well, though I still needed to find some really amateur mistakes. (E.g. it was hiding the submit button when an editing an existing note that had no text. WTF?) Promising, but I'm not ready to vibe!

Back in the robots' comfort zone, they helped me a lot with refactoring Wikipedia fetching for efficiency, and I even let Github Copilot make an autonomous PR to flesh out some OAuth token management. I won't be merging that without a lot of review, of course.
