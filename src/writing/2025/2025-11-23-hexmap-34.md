I started making my own collections and thus tested UX. As a result, site navigation has been changed quite a bit, especially on mobile.

One test user was mistakenly trying to login with email instead of username, so I asked GitHub Copilot to make that possible by creating an issue and tagging the robot. It went off into its little room in the cloud and came back with a PR that worked quite well. It's fascinating to imagine a future where this works so well we can auto-implement features from user voting systems.
