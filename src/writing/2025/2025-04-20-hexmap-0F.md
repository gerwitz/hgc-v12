I put together a request for preoper access to Strava's API and was approved suprisingly quickly. Now I have to prioritize registration so I can enlist some testers.

I put in a lot of focus and got the main map prototyped. A huge step in this was making time-zone-aware date clustering efficient.

There are a lot of problems, but the overall data flow and map client have been proven, which is really energy-giving.
