In order to debug one Strava activity that seems to be failing to resample, I needed to enable scoping not just by dates but also by import sources. There's a lot of nuance to that, and it meant updating code that's still using Cornucopia. It's always tempting to just make little changes, but I'm commited to moving every query I touch to SQLx, so there's been a lot.

Lacking mental energy for some bigger problems, I decided to do something fun and put in deck.gl's experimental timeline widget for scrubbing within a date range. This proved a lot hairier than I thought; initial tests went well but getting the nuances right took quite a while. Now the tiled data fetching for maps gets a lot of time-series detail so the client can calculate colors and depths correctly while scrubbing. I fund it fun to animate and watch local histories.
