Started the week by rebuilding the map tiling backend (no more dependancies) and enabled shading for history (total visits). This was a lot of work, but the new approach of pre-determining parent H3 indices in the reference cells table seems to be paying off by letting Postgresql do more heavy lifting during map views. This pink view looks practically finished and makes me so happy.

Along the way, I had a memory leak and got fed up with the devcontainer I'd started with. So I rebuilt that, which was another big learnign experience. And I enabled dark mode for the maps. Very important.

Then I revisited users and set up registration, with basic scaffolding for accounts. Just enough to let my two alpha testers sign up, which makes me nervous about the UI. So I've begun fiddling with navigation and CSS.
