This week was about basic email. Having written by own SMTP server back in the day, I thought sending emails would be trivial, but of course because of opportunistic assholes we now live in a world of defensive protocols and nothing is so simple. And I forgot I would need to verify email addresses upon registration, which is by nature asynchronous. So, this week was about a lot of code and adopting Mailgun so I could set a simple flag for a user.

I also got started making Strava enhancement work again.
