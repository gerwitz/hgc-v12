Here's a rumor I'd like to start: the Blackberry Storm is a sacrifice play.  RIM is purposefully taking the risk of [alienating some users][2] for a greater defensive purpose, to reinforce the [reflexive disdain][3] many Blackberry users have to (the idea of) the iPhone's keyboard.  If they pick up a Storm it will only further convince them touchscreen keyboards are a farce and dissuade them from investing the few hours' use required to become proficient with an iPhone.
