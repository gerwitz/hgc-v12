Let's accept, for a moment, the ridiculous post-9/11 restrictions on airport egress that imply I'm about an equivalent risk to civil security as an airline passenger as I would be driving a truck with 80,000 pounds of hazardous cargo.

Once they've effectively imprisoned me within the system, can't they at least offer a fenced-in pen for some fresh air?
