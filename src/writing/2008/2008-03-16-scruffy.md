Via Justin Kodama and Shailendra Rao's work on "3D Portable Office" design, [Understanding Office Ecologies
][1], I found David Kirsh's [The Context of Work][2].  This paper is full of insightful models, but the simplest lessons are around the distinction between _neat_ and _scruffy_ office usage "personality types".

I am undeniably a scruffy, preferring to keep information accessible than organized.  Thank god for [Spotlight][3].
