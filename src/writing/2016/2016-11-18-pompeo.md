This is how fascism is bootstrapped.

Mike Pompeo, representative from Kansas, will be the new head of the CIA. His most recent tweet says, regarding Iran:

> I look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the worldâ€™s largest state sponsor of terrorism.

Five years ago, Mr. Pompeo thought that the [Koch Industries illegal business with Iran and bribery were acceptable](https://thinkprogress.org/congressman-from-koch-uninterested-in-investigating-koch-industries-business-deals-with-iran-efd93361507c).

So, if you're a business leader in Iran (local or American) hoping to have the CIA look the other way while they restrict the work of your competitors, make sure you have a line item in your budget for Director Pompeo.
