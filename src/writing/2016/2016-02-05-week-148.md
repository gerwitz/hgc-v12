Weâ€™re having a calm period at the moment. There are two projects underway, but one is well ahead of schedule and the other is straightforward support during implementation of a very small product.

So the internal to-dos begin to bubble up to the top of my priorities. Here is what the glamorous life of a small agency director entails:

- following up on client leads, arranging meetings
- fixing a bug in our homegrown intranet wiki

- helping with Javascript for a visualization project
- documenting our payroll procedures
- evaluating channels for posting job descriptions
- researching tasteful advertising options for [to \[icon\]][3]
