5 years ago, I wrote a [short post](/2009/02/23/bus-driver-appreciation-day.html) calling for bus driver appreciation holiday on March 18th. With a little evangelism, it [took off](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22transit+driver+appreciation+day%22&t=gerwitz) in the US and Canada.

Now, Marek Sieczkowski has published an interview with me about it in [Komunikacja Publiczna](http://www.kzkgop.com.pl/publikacje/wydania/2/w-104-32014-komunikacja-32014.html). This is the quarterly magazine of the KZK GOP, which addresses transportation within Poland's Upper Silesian Industrial Region, which lies at the junction of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.

I have to use a translator to read it, but hopefully [this](/media/2014-08-27-komunikacja/KP3-2014.pdf) will help establish the holiday here in Europe.
