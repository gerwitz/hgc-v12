<p>I'm doing a terrible job of updating this page. I will find a way to publish my latest "weeknote" here, after moving this site to Eleventy.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
  I have a temporary contract with Philips that I expect to become a permanent position.
</p>

<h2>Home</h2>
<p>
  We have many, many projects in queue that just need budget. Meanwhile, my attention is on divesting of our previous homes in the US.
</p>
<p>
  Simply turning on a Hue bulb from a normal light switch means the house needs a brain. I'm testing Home Assistant on a Synology NAS, which may lead to much bigger projects.
</p>

<h2>Cyberspace</h2>
<p>
  My excursions into micropub have led to building my own bridge from that API to this static site. Of course I couldn't just make do and ended up building <a href="https://sitewriter.net/">Sitewriter</a> for this. It's still quiet but there are actual users and that makes it exciting.

Unfortunately, Travis means this is bullshit. I'll need to check git, somehow.
