Our old, just-replaced sofa had some wear but was still quite serviceable. Also, very difficult to squeeze down our stairs and too heavy for us to handle alone.

Thanks to Nextdoor, a neighbor sent some friends to retrieve it, saving us from having to disassemble and discard it. She sent us a nice photo of it deployed in her living room.

It gives me so much joy to see it re-used. Some combination of my "leave no trace" upbringing, "waste not, want not" habits from when I was poor, and local socialism makes me abhor preventable waste.

If everyone shared this personality quirk, I wonder how much our waste stream would be reduced.
