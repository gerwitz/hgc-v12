Deciding how to support the #BlackLivesMatter can be complicated. So, in hope of inspiring others, let me highlight our personal selections:

The [NAACP legal defense fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/) serves the black community in several meaningful ways, both immediately relevant and more strategic.

The [American Civil Liberties Union](https://action.aclu.org/give/aclu-response-covid-19) is always a good choice. Today they are fighting such bullshit as putting open-air, masked protesters in indoor cells together while blaming them for not being safe.

It's unfortunate that [ActBlue's mutual aid and bail funds collective](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd) can be labeled "blue" because taking care of vulnerable people has become a political statement. But even if you're "red" this is a good way to broadly apply timely help.

[Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/) has been working towards sensible US police reform for some time, and is the leading focus fund for this issue today.

[North Campus](http://thenorthcampus.org/) was founded by [Antonio French](https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench), one of the strongest peacekeepers during #Ferguson. They provide social and education programs for youth in North St. Louis.
