I am so disappointed about the Democratic primary this week. I will certainly vote for Sanders or Biden come November, and might even have been happy to do so if Harris or Warren had not been candidates or I had ignored the primary race.

But they were, and I did not. Neither Sanders nor Biden are the first or second best option we had. That we now are choosing between them is an indictment of our culture. We are [sexist](http://dataforprogress.org/blog/3/5/sexism-one-reason-why-warren-didnt-do-better). We have [dramatically failed to mend the wounds of slavery](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-black-vote/). We get the government we deserve.

I will try to focus, now, on the potential to at least repair the federal government, shift the Overton window back towards social justice, and appreciate that Inslee put the environment on the stage and Warren prevented Bloomberg from further validating plutocracy.
