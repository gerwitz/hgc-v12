I’m not going to be clutching my pearls over [the demise of monoculture](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/17/21024439/monoculture-algorithm-netflix-spotify). Somehow, I survived into adulthood without watching _Seinfeld_, _Friends_, _The Office_, etc. and if I was eager for shallow shared experiences I’d watch sports.
