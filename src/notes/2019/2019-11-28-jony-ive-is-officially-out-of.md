[Jony Ive is officially out of Apple](https://www.macg.co/aapl/2019/11/jony-ive-quitte-apple-110177), which was announced months ago.

I am glad for it.

I adore Iveâ€™s aesthetic and appreciate the rigor he maintained for the firm. Yet he was prone to going too far for beauty over function even in hardware, and it was simply a mistake to give him authority over software design.

The iOS 7 reset towards cleanliness may have been necessary, but it took way too long to acknowledge the resulting weaknesses. It should never have even launched with indiscernible buttons and color-only interactive cues, yet we had to wait _years_, until after his departure was announced, for even these basic mistakes to be corrected.
