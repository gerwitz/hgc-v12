- [Bikes with crates taking up too much space](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/12/bikes-are-getting-bigger-and-that-is-putting-pressure-on-parking/)
- [International influence leading some of us to work on the holidays](https://nltimes.nl/2019/12/24/store-staff-pressure-work-christmas-600-increase-open-grocery-stores)
- [The sea will swallow us all because you eat animals and drive everywhere](https://www.politico.eu/article/when-will-the-netherlands-disappear-climate-change/)
