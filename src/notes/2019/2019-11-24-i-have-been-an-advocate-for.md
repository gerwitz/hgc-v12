I have been an [advocate for city government power](https://hans.gerwitz.com/2011/10/20/city-rights.html) for some time, so am very pleased to see [HR 3571](https://www.rand.org/blog/2019/11/city-diplomacy-has-been-on-the-rise-policies-are-finally.html). Too bad it has no chance of becoming law, but I hope it inspires new approaches when the State Department is inevitably rebuilt.
