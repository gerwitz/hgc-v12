[This segment of This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/669/scrambling-to-get-off-the-ice/act-one-4) mentions congressional committee rooms are dramatically unbalanced; the majority party enjoys much nicer offices.

I am astonished by this architectural expression of the competitive dysfunction in democracy, but can't find any relevant history.
