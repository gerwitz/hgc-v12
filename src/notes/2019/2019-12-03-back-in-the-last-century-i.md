Back in the last century I followed a few key people (by which I mean "white men”) closely as the web evolved into an app platform. I just thought to look them up to see where their attention is, today. Maybe I’d find some new inspiration?

- [Tim Bray](https://twitter.com/timbray/) is politically active in admirable ways, and into software architecture that's deeper than my interests.
- [Philips Greenspun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Greenspun) cares mostly about planes and thinks a little too highly of his own social perspective.
- [Craig McClanahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_McClanahan) is retired and offline.
- [Jon Udell](http://jonudell.net/) is making [Hypothesis](http://hypothes.is/) happen, which is awesome.
- [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) is _still_ fighting for feed syndication, bless him, and too caught up in the Trump flurry.
