I find it worrying how often Github Copilot offers to complete my Rust database access code using `.execute()`, which is a method on the very popular sqlx crate, which I am not using. It feels like I'm constantly being judged by a dumb popular kid for making a less popular choice (in my current case, cornucopia).

Our LLM friends could really regress us to the mean more subtly than media consolidation already does.
