SpaceX is doing amazing work, and is full of engineers I really want to celebrate.

I would find the usual regulatory capture antics gross, but that's not why I cannot enjoy their achievement.  It's that every success of these brilliant people is directly empowering their actively-fascist oligarch. And I despise him all the more for this.
