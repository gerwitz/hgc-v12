It's no surprise that training an LLM on material that demonstrates sound reasoning results in better performance, but I'm fascinated by this identification of "cognitive" behaviors (verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, backward chaining). They sound obvious but I also don't recognize them from any study of human reasoning: https://nitter.net/gandhikanishk/status/1896988028893323675
