I have been trying models from 3 providers on 2 very different codebases and using 4 different agent/IDE toolchains. For any given task, all of these variables figure into which setup works best.

Anyone who asserts "this is the best model for coding" is oversimplifying, grifting, or has found an optimal configuration that eludes me.
