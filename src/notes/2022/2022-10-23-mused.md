Our house features a view of the backstage loading area of the [Carré Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Theater_Carré). It's fun to watch the logistics of a wide variety of shows and their respective levels of technical support and security.

Today, I'm very amused to see the unusually nerdy crowd queued up for the Muse show, and lined up in front of our house hoping to see the band arrive. With lots of colored hair, slightly punk style, and not-very-Dutch somatotypes, they made me feel like I was back home on Seattle's Capitol Hill.
