Two podcast episodes brought tears to my eyes yesterday. First, [John Green on sunsets](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-capacity-wonder-and-sunsets) is simply beautiful. Then [This American Life documenting the end of _Roe_ on the ground](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/774/the-pink-house-at-the-center-of-the-world) evoked that “you can never go back” nostalgia for a better America.
