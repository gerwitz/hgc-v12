I am optimistic that in my lifetime we will have the technology to work all the way from desired protein characteristics to the genetic engineering needed to coerce a cell into producing it. This will dramatically change the food production industry, and enable a lot of exciting medicine: https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/protein-design-ai-way

But I also expect to read a lot of breathless reporting about how we're on the cusp of fixing every disease, while continuing to run into disappointment because the complexity of human metabolism remains beyond the reach of engineering.
