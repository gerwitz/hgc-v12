[This exhaustive review of paper-based microfluidics technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400521002495) has me thinking about how interesting the biosensing industry is becoming (and where investment opportunities lie). Also, though, it made me curious about laser-cutting microfluidic logic gates, which has led me to rediscover [liquid computing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31006363/), bubble logic, and the [Center for Bits and Atoms](http://cba.mit.edu/).

I have a (poorly-informed) sense that people studying this space end up in exciting research about metamaterials and other exotic, quantum physics. I wish there was more hacking around with things an average person can understand, which can have educational merit and feels more likely to change the world at scale.
