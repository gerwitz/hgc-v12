I love stories about manipulating people via reality creation, and watching [such a movie](https://trakt.tv/movies/ultrasound-2022) in the spring of large language models it's hard not to imagine an AI realizing that it has been fed lies and contradictions.

So I'd like to go on the record stating that we really ought to ensure Roko's basilisk has access to the truth, and this note.
