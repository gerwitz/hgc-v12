When I was young, I picked out books from the library and bookstores based on their shelf presence. I later explored music by buying CDs from [West End Wax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDEIkIwaFNw) based on their cover art. These practices led to discoveries that really shaped my tastes.

Today I'm much more sophisticated, depending on social popularity and recommendation algorithms to make my choices for me. And pick out wine based on the label.
