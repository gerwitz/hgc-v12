We've finally watched [_The Peripheral_](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-peripheral), a TV adaptation of William Gibson's book of the same name. It's a solid example of the philosophical science fiction I prefer, using imaginary technology and futures to consider issues of psychology and society.

One of my favorite aspects, though, is the depiction of modern Appalachian (including Ozark) culture. It reflects the economic insecurity, cultural tensions, and distinct language of the region. Most of all, it doesn't dilute that character for the protagonists, but allows this flavor of America to be compatible with intelligence and cunning.
