President Trump ignored convention and maintained control of his businesses while in office, and with hindsight we see clearly that this led to him [blatantly profiting from the office](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-sold-his-dc-hotel-gop-spending-disappeared/).
