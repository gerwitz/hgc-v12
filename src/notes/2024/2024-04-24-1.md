I see a lot of experts-of-the-day [gnashing teeth](https://github.com/rabbitscam/rabbitr1) over @rabbit@threads.net being "exposed" for using puppetted Android apps in the cloud: 

What did you all think they were using? Hand-wavy AI magic you've been pretending to understand? Some secret Android API that app developers have been quietly implementing just for them?

This is the obvious way to pull off what they're doing with today's ecosystem. It's funky and pushing the envelope in ways that deserve scrutiny for security and privacy, but isn't this what "innovation" is supposed to look like?
