A parable of our decade in two pieces of nearly-identical hardware:

In 2012 we had the [Descriptive Camera](https://mattrichardson.com/Descriptive-Camera) using Mechanical Turk, as a thought provoking student project and a blog post.

In 2024 we get the [Poetry Camera](https://poetry.camera/) using AI, with a slick website and signups for buying one.
