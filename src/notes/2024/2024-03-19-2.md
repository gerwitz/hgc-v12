At this point, it's boring to observe there exists a West Coast techno-utopian culture bubble where people think advanced AI is the biggest threat we should worry about, the treatment for hatred is more free speech, meritocracy will address inequity, etc.

It's strange to have left it and observe from outside. I actually have some nostalgia, and sometimes roll my eyes with a subtle pang of yearning for the comforting embrace of that myopia.
