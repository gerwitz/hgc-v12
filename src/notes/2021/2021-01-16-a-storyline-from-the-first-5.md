A storyline from the first 5 episodes of _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_, which seems quite relevant a half-century later, as [summarized on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Rogers'_Neighborhood_(season_1)):

> Lady Elaine's changes to the geography of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe worry King Friday, who begins to impose new rules and restrictions in Make-Believe, and builds a wall.

> Meanwhile, King Friday worries about an invasion of people who want to change the Neighborhood of Make-Believe and drafts her (Lady Aberlin) as a border guard.

> Because of the new rules and restrictions in Make-Believe, Cornflake S. Pecially refuses to visit the castle. Chef Brockett delivers a cake to King Friday, who is suspicious of more changes, cuts the cake into many pieces to inspect it.

> At the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, King Friday still wants to protect his province, so he sends Handyman Negri to install punch clocks at both ends of it.

> Betty Aberlin takes some helium balloons to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Tagging them with a message of peace, she floats them above the castle. When King Friday reads the message, he ceases his efforts to stop change. The wall is taken down.
