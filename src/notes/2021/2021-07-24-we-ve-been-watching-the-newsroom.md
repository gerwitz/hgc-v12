We've been watching _The Newsroom_, a typically cheesy-intellectual Aaron Sorkin drama from 2012â€“2014 that glorified journalism. At times the concerns raised seem quaint when viewed from the Trump era. Mostly, though, it's easy to get wrapped up in the wistful nostalgia for a time when the news was taken seriously as a public good.

It seems timely, then, that we viewed a few episodes while the streets outside were shut down for a memorial to [Peter R de Vries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_R._de_Vries), an investigative reporter recently assassinated. Thousands of people queued in half-kilometer line to simply pay respects to a beloved journalist, in a society that still values the Fourth Estate.
