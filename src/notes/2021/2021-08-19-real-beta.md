It's nice to see Apple using [beta to improve (correct) UI design with public feedback](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-safari-design-changes-ios-15-beta-6/), but I still don't feel good about Alan Dye's UX team. Replacing Greg Christie with a graphic designer was worse than losing Jobs.
