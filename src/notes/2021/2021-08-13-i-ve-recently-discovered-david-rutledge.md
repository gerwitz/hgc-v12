I've recently discovered David Rutledge's _The Philosopher's Zone_ and am bingeing on it.

Today I listened to an [episode with Aileen Moreton-Robinson](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/tracks-of-thought/12948500) who (rightly) criticizes rationalist Enlightenment philosophy for being reductionist and understanding the world through segmentation, as opposed to her indigenous Australian tradition which focuses on the relationships between things and systems.

Shortly after this I listened to [Steven Nadler describe Spinoza](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/the-monstrous-heretic-spinoza-philosophy/12654224), my favorite Enlightenment precursor, as treating the relationships between things and their contexts within systems as fundamental to his ethics.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ philosophy contains multitudes.
