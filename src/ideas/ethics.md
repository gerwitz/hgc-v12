epitaph: "remains akratic"

Being logically minded, consequentialism has always appealed to me. But Peter Singer's global utilitarianism feels too far. I feel it is right to "unfairly" prioritize my neighbors, family, and friends.

Care ethics (as described by Stephanie Collins) frames good in terms of our relationships and their dependancies of vulnerability. This doesn't _replace_ consequentialism for me, but heavily refines it.

Free will and, thus, "good" and "bad" characterization of people is a wrong-but-working model for ethics.
