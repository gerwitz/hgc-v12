Logic in academic philosophy feels like lawyers talking about math. Budhhist logic sounds meaningful. 

I need to learn more from Koji Tanka: https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/buddhist-logic/13628656

I think: the point is discovering truth, not only formalizing the process. You are "doing logic" only when you have cognition and, presumably, learn something.
