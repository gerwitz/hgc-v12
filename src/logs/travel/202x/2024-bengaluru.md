I upgraded to a ridiculous 115 m2 suite, which has been useful a few times when we both need to be on work calls. Still, it's ridiculous.

Some highlights:

The original [MTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavalli_Tiffin_Room) followed by a walk in the Lalbagh botanical garden.

[Dinner at Farmlore](/logs/dining/2024-farmlore).

[Cooking class](https://www.viator.com/tours/Bangalore/Cook-and-Dine-Experience-at-NamiS-Kitchen-Bengaluru/d5310-402534P1) in the home of Namita the dentist.

Visiting the new Philips office and finally meeting some of my  DLS team of yore.

A hike with some of Shannon's colleagues, getting lost off-trail in Avalahalli forest.
