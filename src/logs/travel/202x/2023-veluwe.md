To kick-off our staycation week, Shannon booked a [cute little cabin](https://putterheijde.nl/tiny-stay) outside Putten, in the [Veluwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veluwe). We [rode there](https://www.strava.com/activities/9679139547) on our racebikes with all our stuff in backpacks on Saturday, went for [a long trails walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/9685670753) on Sunday, and [rode back](https://www.strava.com/activities/9690367098) on Monday. It was all lovely, but highlights included a [pin garden](https://schovenhorst.nl/bomentuin/vijf-bomentuinen/) featuring a [170-yr old sequoia](https://www.monumentaltrees.com/nl/nld/gelderland/putten/146_landgoedschovenhorst/198/)
