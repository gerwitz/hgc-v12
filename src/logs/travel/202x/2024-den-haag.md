The semiannual company events took me to Den Haag for two weeks, but I commuted via NS rail every day except one when we had a late team dinner and I needed to be ready early the next morning.

The commuting was exhausting and I probably should have stayed more often. But the hotel was _meh_ and coming home to Shannon and cats, if only to sleep (for too little time) is a welcome reset.
