New Orleans friends are having a birthday trip, so we flew down to share some time with them.

On Monday morning the four of us used a group tour to skip the queue into the Vatican museums, which led to us standing in rain for 40 minutes listening to a guide ramble and then skipping the papel apartments. Thankfully, we realized this just in time and ended up leaving our group after the Sistine Chapel and speedrunning a repeat tour on our own so we could visit the Raphael rooms.
