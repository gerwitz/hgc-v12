US friends had excess miles so made a trip to Italy, we joined in Florence to have nise meals and walks with them.

Dinner at the [Osteria del Pavone](http://osteriadelpavone.it/) was a real treat, along with a bottle of orange wine from "la casa del gatto" not labeled for retail, and a
2018 red (purportedly one of only 300 bottles) from [Rasenna in Tuscany](http://rasennaintuscany.com/), made "Etruscan style" with more than grapes and aged in buried clay jars. Both were quite special and the latter was a sort of bucket list item for me.

Florence is of course beautiful, but was too hot (above 30Â°) and too busy (with American tourists) for me.
