Shannon took me to Paris for my 50th birthday, specifically for dinner at [L'Arpège](/logs/dining/2024-arpege). We also enjoyed the Musée des Arts et Métiers and a long walk to the [Petite Ceinture](https://www.salutfromparis.com/petite-ceinture-paris-15/) of the 16th arrondissement.

My highlight, though, was discovering [La Malicia](https://www.lebonbon.fr/paris/drink-decouvertes/la-malicia-bar-mystique-clandestin-paris/), a speakeasy hidden within a mezcaleria that is hidden behind the kitchen of a restaurant within a hotel. It was only possible to find because the staffed to show you, and is an intimate space with fabulous decor, great music, and a good menu. Nothing is in English, of course, but we were made to feel quite welcome and sat right at one-way mirrors that offered serreptitious people watching of the "outer speakeasy" mezcaleria.

The [drunken ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/10926618443) back via the Champs-Elysées was fun, too.
