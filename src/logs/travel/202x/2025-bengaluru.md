After my plans for work in Frankfurt were nullified, Shannon invited me to join her in Benagaluru for two weeks. I left two days earlier, though, because the flight was significantly more affordable.

It was pleasant and I really enjoyed meeting up with local friends Sam, Thiru, and Vikas. What had convinced me to make the trip, though, was [dinner at Farmlore](/logs/dining/2025-farmlore).

I got a fair amount of city walking in, including some nearby forest as we stayed near their office, pretty far on the edge of the city. I was really struck by how much the not-pedestrian-oriented areas reminded me of walking in Phoenix.

This is my first time to India, I think, where the horn noise of the streets didn't take any time at all to adjust to. It just feels normal, like so much of this once-shocking place. I am so grateful to have a life that's allowed me to acclimate to such a different and wonderful culture.
