Celebrating the end of the pandemic, again, with Mardi Gras first weekend. Of course we rode with the Krewe of Freret. Again we brought friends from Seattle and Amsterdam. They were all new to the experience, so we joined them on a "normal" float.

There are so many people in the krewe's orbit that we have only met a few times, and not often, that nonetheless feel like family. Southern hospitality is real, y'all. I wish we could visit each other regularly.

Continuing symptoms from Omicron put a big damper on my general enjoyment and scuttled hopes of extending our stay to the main weekend. But adreneline and alchohol made parade day a great one, even if I crashed out a bit early.

Obligatory trip to Florida to see mom on the way back was uneventful. As always, it is strange to re-experience stripmall America as deeply familiar and yet foreign.
