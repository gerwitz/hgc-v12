Rode with Krewe of Freret (on Captain's float) for Mardi Gras first weekend. Jet lag was terrible, weather on parade day was cold, wet, and windy. Not good conditions, but it's always an exciting event and it's great to catch up with so many good people.

Then onward to St. Louis to catch up with Shannon's parents, my uncle Edgar and aunt Kathe, and Ryan. Finally we adjusted to CST on the last day. ðŸ™„
