Shannon and I shared an AirBnB with Abdul and Aahd while they made arrangements for their new vacation home nearby.

Pandemic restrictions and work days made it feel more like a business trip than a holiday. Still, after 16 months without travel it was a welcome escape and outdoor dining let us socialize with each other as if life was normal.
