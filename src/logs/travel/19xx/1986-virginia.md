Joined Dad work conference in Virginia, then drove onward to Washington DC, stayed with Kuhlman relatives.

I specifically remember enjoying [Tilted Arc](https://greg.org/archive/2024/04/03/the-history-of-tilted-arc-is-long.html) and the major Smithsoneans in DC, and the Jefferson Memorial made a big impression.

My father also took us on a pilgramage to Arlington. For the history of Lee's plantation, not the cemetary.
