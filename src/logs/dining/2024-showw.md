Jeroen was raving about this new place, so we scheduled a visit with him to celebrate the end of Shannon's "unempoyment". The new role may be great, but I really want to honor how much creative work she got done during her year between jobs.

Dinner was great. No dish really stood out as something to remember for years, but nothing fell flat, either. The service was consistently good. They'll easily earn a Michelin star, I think.

I loved that they described paired wines only _after_ the accompanying course.
