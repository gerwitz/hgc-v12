The story of [Alain Passard's vegetable awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Passard#Vegetable_farming) is legend, so of course his restaurant has been on our wishlist for some time. It's quite pricey and not exactly convenient, but Shannon decided to [take me for a major birthday](/logs/travel/2024-paris/).

It was lovely, but the service and imagination of the food did not quite live up to expectations. Not _disappointing_, though, except that it is quite clear that serving full vegetarian meals is an exception they accomodate, not a matter of course as with so many fine restaurants in the Ntherlands. Parisians gonna Paris, I guess.
