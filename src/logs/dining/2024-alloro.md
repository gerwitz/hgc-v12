For last-minute reservations with Bobby and Allison, we looked for a place with radishes (4) and stars (1) not too far. This place certainly deserved the star, but I'm not sure about all the radishes; the only dissapointment was the "main" on the vegetarian tasting menu, which featured a thick chickpea-based patty that might as well been a sandwich from any decent lunch shop. Otherwise, great food, wine, and company.
