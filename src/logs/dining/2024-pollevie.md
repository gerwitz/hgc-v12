For our second anniversary-week dinner we took the train down to 's-Hertogenbosch to a [five radish](https://weresmartworld.com/we-re-smart-green-guide/pollevie) place that was unassuming but very nice. We shared the wine and non-alcholic pairings, and the kafirs were excellent. The service won't be contending for any Michelin stars, but was great by casual standards. And the food was absolutely fine-dining material.
