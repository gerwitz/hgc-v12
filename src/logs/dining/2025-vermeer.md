For Shannon's birthday, a place she remembers fondly.

It turns out they have had a complete change of staff. They lost their Michelin star, of course, but the new chef is clearly aiming to earn it back. They did not offer a printed vegetarian menu, but he was quite competent without using meat. I especially appreciated not having one big, heavy "main" course to fill me up too much.

Our server was an amateaur and somehow seemed to be both trying too hard and too casual. The somelier, however, previously of Flore, was delightful and the pairings were inspired. Every dish was made better for them.
