Very reminiscent of Haoma (Bangkok), and also the setting of [The Menu](https://trakt.tv/movies/the-menu-2022), we sat at the "chef's table" bar here. It was not quite as much of a bar experience as El Invernadero (Madrid), but did afford us opportunites to chat with chef JE (who shares our love of New Orleans) and watch him overseeing the operation. It was interesting how holistic his management was, from the back kitchen operations through the service of every table.

The food was as one might expect from a Michelin-starred establishment, though the French guide apparently cannot be bothered to acknowledge India. Besides relying on hyper-local ingredients, we enjoyed the distance from the trends of the moment in Europe. And our wine pairings were all from Karnataka; none were mind-blowing, but each was quite good. I'm glad to have discovered [KRSMA](https://www.krsmaestates.com).
