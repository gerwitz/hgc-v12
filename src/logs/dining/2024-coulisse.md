Andres my [hair stylist](https://geknipt-amsterdam.nl/) recommended this place, so I scheduled a dinner for just before a business trip.

It was nice; not too formal, the vibe felt a bit like Entrepot. The menu was a little on the bitter side, but more playful and less on-trend than most. We both appreciated it. The wines chosen for the pairings were all good, though the interplay with the food was not inspired.

I would definitely recommend it as a gateway to fancy dining.
