This installment in our [Awful dining series](/logs/events/2024-awful/) was for my birthday. Again Jeroen and Shannon collaborated on the menu for 8 people, this time with each course named for one of my [life event entries](/logs/events/). This drove a lot of embarassing discussion, at least until we got far enough down the line that my friends were familiar or, at least, too durnk to be curious.
