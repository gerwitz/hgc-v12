When we built out [the atelier](/logs/events/2022-awful/) we put in a full kitchen specifically so Jeroen could [get his chef on](/logs/dining/2022-home/). Shortly after our opening party, he and Shannon again put on a top-notch dining experience, with 8 courses for 8 people. The dishware was entirely Shannon's kiln work.

The menu was entitled "The First Supper" and I hope it won't be the last.
