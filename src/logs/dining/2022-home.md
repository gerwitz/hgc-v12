Our friend Jeroen has experience cheffing and wanted to use our kitchen. So we arranged a dinner for 7 (including chef). Shannon collaborated with him to pair cocktails with the courses, and I don't recall how many there were.

He did a huge amount of prep and really created some special dishes. This transcended a normal dinner party.
