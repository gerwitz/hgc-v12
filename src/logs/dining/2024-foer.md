Our final anniversary-week dinner, at another casual fine-dining place discovered on [We're Smart Green Guide](https://weresmartworld.com/we-re-smart-green-guide). It was a delight with an imaginative menu, and great service. When we indicated interest in both wine and non-alcholic pairings, they simply brought us the better of each for every course.

Mostly I will remember having this experience on their terrace, though. It's too rare that this level of dining experience can be enjoyed outdoors.
