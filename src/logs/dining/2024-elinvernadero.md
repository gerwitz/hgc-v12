Shannon and I had so far been to 4 of the top 20 in [We're Smart's restaurant ranking](https://weresmartworld.com/were-smart-top-100-2023) so when we realized number 2 is in Madrid, we made plans to visit during [my work trip](https://hans.gerwitz.com/logs/travel/2024-spain/).

Despite that ranking, we were taken aback by how good the experience was. It is small an intimate, moreso because we sat at the "bar" while they served us seemingly 132 small courses. Pairings included creative wine-based mixes, and every dish was simple in ingredients, elaborate in preparation, and beautiful in presentation. The presentation of many was concurreny, with several steps from a raw ingredient being displayed between preceding dishes.

We enjoyed it so much, [I returned the next week](/logs/dining/2024-elinvernadero-2).
