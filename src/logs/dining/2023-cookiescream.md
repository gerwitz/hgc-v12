Making the best of a business trip, we needed strong recommendations for this veggie, starred place hiding in a loading dock.

It was a great dinner, very "Berlin" vibes. Because it was a work night I interleaved the non-alchoholic pairings which were an unexpected delight.

Afterwards, we indulged in some time at the entrance bar, which turned out to be quite special with a lot of juicing and mixing of kafirs and fatwashing alongside a more traditional understanding of cocktails. Could be a contender for favorite bars in Europe.
