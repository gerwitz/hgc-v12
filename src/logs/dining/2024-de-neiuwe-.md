Our foodie friend Jeroen treated us to dinner at this vegan kitchen as a joint birthday present. It's top of the [best vegetable restaurants list](https://weresmartworld.com/were-smart-top-100-2023) and has two Michelein stars plus a green.

The service was good but not as special as two stars implies. It was especially nice how positive the vibe of the staff was; it reminded me of flying Alaska Airlines, the way everyone seemed happy to be there and alongside their colleagues.

The food was consistently great, including focused flavors (one ingredient prepared many ways) and more complex arrangements. We appreciated the lack of a cliche "main course" with too much quantity. They could have been more courageous, though, with using spices and legumes.
