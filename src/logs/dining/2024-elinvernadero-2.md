After [dinner here](/logs/dining/2024-elinvernadero) I made a reservation for a second visit the following week, this time with Hayden and Hartmut. A slightly smaller menu, without Shannon's company, and far less surprising the second time, of course. Still delightful; I'd have gone a third week if I was still in town.
