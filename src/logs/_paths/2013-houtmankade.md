## morning path via Centraal Starbucks

## reverse journey
Walked from Prinseneiland, over <a href="http://www.bruggenvanamsterdam.nl/prinseneiland_hoek_galgenstraat.htm" class="external">bridge 321</a> and under the tracks towards the Haarlemmerplein. We watched them install a new fountain in the plaza that's popular for kids to play in.

Crossed under the <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlemmerpoort_(Amsterdam)" class="external">Haarlemmerpoort</a>
and crossed the Singel on the <a href="http://www.bruggenvanamsterdam.nl/korte_marnixkade_hoek_haarlemmer.htm" class="external">Willemsbrug</a>. The bridge has to be hosed down in summer, and is raised pretty frequently because it's on the Staande Mastroute.

Turning north again, we have to cross under the tracks and end up at the office on the Houtmankade, having walked 700 meters when a crow could have flown only 265.
