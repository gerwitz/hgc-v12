From CHS to SeaTac to SFO to SoMa Starbucks on 4th then walk Brannan to from studio on 3rd.

This particular path was only a dozen times, but being my first regular inter-city travel left quite an impression. All this trouble just to move me around with the iPhone playing music made me feel like a big shot.
