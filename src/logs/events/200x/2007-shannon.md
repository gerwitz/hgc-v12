Shannon and I had our first date at the Tivoli to see [Manufactured Landscapes](https://www.edwardburtynsky.com/projects/films/manufactured-landscapes) followed by an [unpretentious South Grand Vietnamese restaurant](https://www.lemongrass-rest.com/) (her choice) and trespassing at [MoBot](https://www.mobot.org/).
