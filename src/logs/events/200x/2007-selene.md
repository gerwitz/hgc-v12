Being single meant I had no access to a car. I had too much male pride to ask Shannon to drive us for our first date, so a few days after asking her out I bought a barely-used, black 2006 Mazda Miata.

It had paddle shifters which I enjoyed more than expected, and was a joy to drive. But with newer safety standards to meet, it was noticably heavier and had higher doors, which made it feel less like a toy than my old Miata, and more like a car.
