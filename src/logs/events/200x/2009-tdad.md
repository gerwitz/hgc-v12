My biggest claim to fame is that I wrote a [blog post](/2009/02/23/bus-driver-appreciation-day.html) declaring a new holiday. We called it Bus Driver Appreciation Day but cities with trains adjusted that to Transit Driver Appreciation Day. By 2021, King County Metro was celebrating Transit Operator Appreciation Week and March 18th was widely published as a [minor secular observance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_secular_observances).

This is my legacy.
