Iâ€™m uncertain about the timing, but believe it was after I was discharged from [Hyland](/logs/events/1991-hyland/) that Colleen was evicted from her apartment and we started living out of her [station wagon](https://www.dodge-wiki.com/wiki/Plymouth_Reliant).

I am reluctant to claim experiencing homelessness, because I could have run back to my parents, we slept in the back of the [MBE](/logs/events/1988-mbe/) when the heat was unbearable, and it was for less than a full year. Never was my privilege as low as the people sleeping in the underbrush along the riverbank north of Downtown.

It was quite a formative experience, but arguably less so than later years when paying rent meant insufficient money for food.
