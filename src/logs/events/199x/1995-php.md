My internet hobbies were still focused on networking protocols, system security[^hacker], and the proto-Minecraft worlds of [MOOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO) (especially LambdaMOO and MicroMUSE). But I was increasingly reading web-posted content, usually discovered via Usenet. I had salvaged and repaired a Macintosh SE/30 that had an Ethernet card, which I used to connect it to an old PC running FreeBSD that I set put o automatically dial for IP and NAT it to the Mac. Staying connected was very important to me.

Having a GUI machine made the web much more appealing. One of those essays [Philips Greenspun](http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/server-programming) posted one that really inspired me to play with CGI, which felt full of potential but quite tedious. Then I discovered PHP/FI and became enthralled with developing dynamic web pages.
