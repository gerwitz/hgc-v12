Colleenâ€™s station wagon, the one we had lived out of in 1991, was rendered useless by a hit-and-run in front of our apartment on Arsenal. Her father helped us find a functioning car for something like $400: a white 1983 Buick Skyhawk. I learned quite a bit about auto maintenance from his assistance keeping it running.
