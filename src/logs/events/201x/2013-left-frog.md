Our time at frog ended abruptly with an [implosion](2013-amsterdam). I like to shorten this story to "they told us we had to move back to the US, but we had just [moved our cat](2013-moved-shea) so we quit."

Of course it's more complicated than that. I [wrote about the bitter end](/2014/03/30/pond-reflection.html) while I was still angry. Obviously, though, we made it work.
