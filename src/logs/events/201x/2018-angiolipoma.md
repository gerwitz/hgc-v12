It wasn’t major, but having gone 44 years with “all my original parts” made having a surgeon take a knife to me feel intimidating.

I have extensive lipomas small, benign tumors on my legs and arms. They mostly aren’t noticeable to myself or others,
but some of them are angiolipoma, which can cause discomfort and even become quite painful in some conditions.

In the US, this is considered cosmetic and not covered by insurance. In the Netherlands, even the basic public coverage includes lipoma and I decided it was time to address some of the worst tumors around my right knee. Unfortunately, while the expensive surgery in the US is often no-scar endoscopy, that’s not yet true here. So, the scalpel it was.
