I was completely unprepared to find work in Amsterdam after frog, so it took two months. Thankfully, Shannon had enough freelance work to cover our basic living expenses and the house in Seattle was often rented.

I finally signed up as a strategist with AKQA, working on a German design account. It went well enough they later offered me a long term position as the strategy lead on a key UK account. But that account was more traditional and I didn't enjoy the local company culture enough to stay.

Those 4 months were very valuable for the insights I gained being part of another global agency.
