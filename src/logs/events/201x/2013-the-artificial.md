AKQA offered me long-term work, but I hadn’t really found a home there. The work and clients were interesting but the general atmosphere was a bit “sweat shop” and made me miss frog.

Meanwhile, we’d found some more real projects for The Artificial and I was spending a lot of time helping Shannon after hours. So when my contract ended I became an employed Director and started reporting to the garage.
