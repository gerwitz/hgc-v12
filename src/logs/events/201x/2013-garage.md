The Artificial quickly grew from a shell for Shannon to freelance and secure our immigration status to a real entity as we hired [our first designer](http://www.joszczepanska.com/). So we needed an office on a budget.

The garage we found on the Houtmankade was perfect. Near home, plenty of raw space, a little outdoor area and dramatic opening to the street and canal.

It was only recently turned into an office, so there were some quirks. The time it flooded was particularly dramatic.
