After 7 years of renting our prior home from afar, we were running our of cash. We didnâ€™t lose money, but gradually converted it into equity by paying the mortgage. Eventually that leads to no liquid assets and we had to start converting our Euros to Dollars to cover the bills.

It felt like letting go of Seattle, which is quite bittersweet.
