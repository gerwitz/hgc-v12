I spent 9 years in the same small parish school, where the “advanced math group” consisted only of myself and the “cool kids” consisted of everyone _except_ me. Then I joined the most exclusive high school in town where being smart was expected and simply being there made you cool.

Though my time at [SLUH](https://www.sluh.org/) did not end well, I still remember the three years I spent there fondly and am grateful for how much more confident they made me. The education was top-notch, too.
