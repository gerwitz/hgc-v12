Much before I was led to expect, I had to start wearing glasses again sometime during my freshman year in high school. This became clear when I needed to sit at the front of the class in order to read the chalkboard.

At least this time it was a simple correction for near-sightedness, and even though glasses were still not-cool nerdy in American culture they were perfectly fine in my [new school](./1988-sluh/).
