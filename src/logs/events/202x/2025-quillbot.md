After [joining the ranks of serious AI users](/2025/07/06/hexmap-20.html), I couldn't pass up the opportunity to work for a young company with established expertise and an office in Amsterdam.

It's a smaller company and I'm "farther from CEO" than before, but I respect their product management org more than any I've seen. I think I bring some valuable perspective, and certainly expect to learn a lot from them.
