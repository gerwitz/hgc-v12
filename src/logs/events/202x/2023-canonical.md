In November, Shannon shared a Head of Design listing on LinkedIn with me that sounded like my cup of tea. I hit "apply" on a lark. After an extensive written interview, two screening tests, and 9 interviews, I accepted the job at the end of March. The timing to leave Philips doesn't seem right, but the opportunity to join Canonical with their mission that so nicely aligns with my interests is not one I dare pass up.
