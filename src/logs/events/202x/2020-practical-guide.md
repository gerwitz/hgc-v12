[The Practical Guide to Experience Design](https://practical.guide/) was published during the early COVID-19 isolation. Besides making Shannon [my favorite author](/2020/05/01/practical-guide.html), it feels like a sort of closure for [The Artificial](/projects/the-artificial/). Really, it would be fair to characterize The Artificial as a project that culminated in her book, which scaled our mission to help designers learn how to be effective well beyond our natural reach.
