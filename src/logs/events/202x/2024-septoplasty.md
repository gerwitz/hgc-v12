As long as I can remember, I've had chronic issues with my nose running, sneezes, nosebleeds, and sinus infections. Except when I couldn't afford medicine, I've always been on antihistamines. Only this year did I get a prescription for a nasal spray that seems to help, but my new huisarts (GP) also referred me to an ENT specialist despite not seeing anything wrong with my nasal passages.

The specialist finally confirmed my longstanding suspicion that I had a deviated septum. So I underwent my first general anesthesia surgery and had this corrected along with some ablation of the turbinates. I'm writing this while recovering, but am optimistic that fixing the mechanical problem rather than remediating with drugs will be a noticable, long-overdue, quality-of-life improvement.
