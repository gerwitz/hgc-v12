My stepfather, Lou Baumer passed away. He was 91, had cancer that progressed quickly and went peacefully at home.

He and my mother were married for 28 years, yet I left home before that and they moved to Florida not long after, so I never got to know him that well. He was very caring and generous in most contexts. He was also very much of his generation and, to put it mildly, not as progressive as me.

So my emotions about this event are very centered on the wellbeing of my mother, rather than the loss of Lou himself or my own feelings.
