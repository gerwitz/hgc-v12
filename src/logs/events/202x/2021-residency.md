The IND accepted my application for indefinite, permanent residency. Shannon's followed later in the week. This is the payoff for studying Dutch and taking all the exams.

Now we no longer depend on employment to live in the Netherlands (or the other 24 EU countries that acknowledge long-term residence EC permits), and have almost all of the rights of citizenship.
