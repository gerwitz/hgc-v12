I want to build a whiteboard printer.  Functionally like the [txtBOMBER][1], with dry-erase markers.  
[Fine Expo Clicks][2] are small-diameter and could be closed without unloading from the printer.  
Staggering the markers could allow for overlapping for a more subtle "scanline" artifact.  
An Arduino controller could store a font and output simple text, or it could only speak bitmap and offload type rendering to a server.  The latter would enable graphics and could lead to scan-and-copy functionality.
