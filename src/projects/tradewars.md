title: TradeWars
---

In 2012 I [tweeted about bringing old games to modern app stores](https://twitter.com/gerwitz/status/175046529151811584). Then I thought to be the change I want to see in the world, and found [some inspiration](https://twdata.sourceforge.net/kokua/). So I began building an iOS client for [TradeWars](http://www.tradewars.com/) that would work against a telnet deployment. But, at the time, this meant learning Objective-C, which I quickly lost interest in.

I made this project page to remind me to try again someday, either in SwiftUI or as a web app.
