_to [icon]_ was a long-lived side project of [The Artificial](/projects//the-artificial/), launched in 2014.

As we scaled the aagency up, we were often creating quick mockups and prototyping. By then, [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) was long-established as the primary resource for visual assets that could be used for these. It had grown quickly and the quality level of icons there had declined, so searching for a good stand-in often became an exercise of sifting through poorly-conceived or sloppily-executed chaff. And we didn't need clip-art to depict objects as much as icons for use in UI to represent user actions. Our icon sets were thus verb-oriented and held to Shaannon's typically high quality standards.

To organize them, I developed[^roos] a site in Ruby on Rails with an administrative interface for a metadata database and high-performance public browsing view. As a sort of proof-of-concept that the web was ready, the icons were rendered as inline SVGs.

[^roos]: For a while we had a development intern we'd mentored via Rails Girls, [Roos de Bildt](https://www.roosbeeldt.com/), who contributed a lot to the site's codebase.

Our quality standards and the site became a [learning exercise](/2017/12/06/week-244.html) for our designers. To use their bench time contributing to the collections, they had to learn to work with a coarse grid for pixel-snapping at low resolutions, be consistant with their color palette and line weights, think about how each icon fit into a taxonomy of verbs (with primary and secondary labels) and what non-verb tags would be useful for searching, and understand a workflow that included SVG production and git commits.

As we built up the library and site, we thought to use is as an experiment for the agency to learn what it's like to run a Kickstarter. We gained [a little publicity](https://www.fastcompany.com/3029584/universal-symbols-for-verbs-from-headbanging-to-hallucinating) and mostly learned that Kickstarter backers have a seriously outsized sense of entitlement over product development. We also threw one of our first of our [agency parties](https://artificial.design/archives/2014/09/12/launchparty.html).

Over the years, the published library grew to 4198 icons in 20 distinctly-styled sets.

It was fun to have a "product" to manage, as we experimented with fashionable growth hacking techniques and rolled out new features like curated collections. Although the last new icons were published over 4 years ago and we never finish plans to offer color-customized downloads for paid subscriptions, it continued to hum along.

As I write this in mid-2022 there are still about 100 unique visitors each day, each spending an average of 2 minutes visiting more than 4 pages, and over 10% of them choose to download an icon or collection. That's added up to over 2.7 million downloads so far!

It is sad to retire a product that thousands of people find value in each month, but the site has bitrot and is full of security holes. To maintain it will require I give up other projects or find a way to make the site pay for its own support. But though this level of popularity seems big to me, it's tiny in terms of advertising options. Other monetization options would be difficult for me with half of the traffic coming from China.

So, I can't justify further development and am taking the site offline to prevent it becoming a malware host.
