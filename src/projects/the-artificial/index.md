Shannon and I [started an agency](https://hans.gerwitz.com/2018/06/07/the-artificial-genesis.html.html).

We did great work and enjoyed an [amazing office](/2018/06/13/week-271.html). Fortune granted us a specialty in connected product UX design which meant most of our projects were interesting and meaningful.

The company itself was a huge project, and I am proud of even the mundane things like processes, clean accounting, knowledge management, and even [the web site](./website/). Helping Shannon learn to manage a team and individuals refined my own skills, and I learned so much about business in general.

But, eventually, [we moved on](https://hans.gerwitz.com/2018/07/24/week-277.html). The legacy lives on not only with [the Artificier alumni](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetPastCompany=%5B%223202291%22%5D), but in the [book Shannon published](/history/events/2020-practical-guide/) afterwards.
