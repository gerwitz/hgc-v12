As we hired designers and took on new clients, we outgrew FreeAgent and migrated to Xero for aaccounting and Shannon created a rigorous framework for planning and tracking work. I built a baasic intranet site with Rails for keeping track of project details and to document processes, the employee handbook, etc.

As part of this, I ended up building a [Rails engine wiki](https://github.com/TheArtificial/rails-wiki) tool that used git for storaage. So even though the tool has been decommissioned, aall that content survives as a git repository of markdown files, with nearly 3500 commits of history.

I was never very proud of this software. I never killed every bug caused by ephemeral server instances shaaring content through git. But I was very proud of the content we assembled. Shannon and I regularly wrote to it as we educated our team, which resulted in a rich set of approach documentaation and citations. Far from being lost to history, this became source documentation for Shannon's book, _[The Practical Guide to Experience Design](https://practical.guide/)_ which is not yet a best-seller but has reportedly been a valuable tool for hundreds of designers around the world.

It would be fair to characterize The Artificial as a project that culminated in her book, teaching us a lot along the way but most importantly scaling our mission to help designers learn how to be effective well beyond our natural reach.
