title: Coolify
---

UX wishlist from 4.0.0-beta

- network ports view from server view
- assume environment when there's only one and list resources under project
- view project environment variables from project view
- UI to select from available shared variables in resource envvar view (and optionally auto-include all from project)
- simple left nav with only projects, servers, and Coolify settings, expandable in-panel
- separate deployment and network configuration (in resource views)
