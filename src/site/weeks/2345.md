This week made me feel better about going in-house. Most of it was spent in a “boot camp” series of workshops that are part of the early, strategic side of an organization redesign with fairly large scope. It took me longer than it should have to assert my own goals, but I was able to. Most importantly, this time was spent with colleagues I didn’t yet know who are largely competent, professional, and surprisingly willing to set aside their own political needs.
