My manager is switching roles and I'm inheriting her current one. Career-wise this opens opportunities to focus even more on the intersection of my own passions and the firm's needs. It's bittersweet, though, as I enjoyed working with her and will be launched into a new layer of corporate politics before I was even comfortable with the one I entered into.

Do not let me be like so many others and bemoan how much organizational chaos interferes with my agency. There is ample opportunity to control your own fate, even if the feedback loops are a bit slow.

At home, after more than a year of planning, we finally have new windows! Now, when a heavy rain comes, we can worry only about the roof leaking.
