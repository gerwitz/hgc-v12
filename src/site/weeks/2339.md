I've officially started work in a new role, but nearly everyone is on holiday. So I have a nice bit of quiet to consider what's ahead, and pester my former manager for more handover.

A new year is always cause for reflection, and of course the big event of 2018 was closing The Artificial studio. The memory may be bittersweet, but Shannon and I are both glad we did.
