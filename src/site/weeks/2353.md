The political nature of work life in a large corp is making me doubt going in-house. Life is too short to be spent forcing myself into the lives of people who would prefer to protect their status quo.

We reviewed our architect's preliminary plans for house renovations, which is a weird mix of exciting. It gives me energy to see the possibilities, and exhausts me to think about the costs (not only in money, but in time and life disruption). Hopefully the balance shifts to positive thoughts as the rest of my life simplifies.
