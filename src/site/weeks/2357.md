Work is becoming more relaxed. There’s no danger of boredom, but I spend less time feeling urgency. That might change, soon, but it feels like an accomplishment to have a handle on my current scope.

I feel pretty good, lately, about the top-level leadership in the company. Middle management has plenty of struggles ahead, though, with disruptions to the status quo.

It was a busy social week, including an office opening party by the friend’s agency that has recently subsumed different friends’ agency. It’s strangely liberating to feel like the mantle of entertaining has been passed on from The Artificial.
