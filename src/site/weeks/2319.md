Beginning to see my challenge themes: goal and responsibility alignment, my ability to influence, and team discipline.

Scale makes communication a challenge and leads to high meeting load. I'm not sure what to do about this; even if shifting the culture to artifacts is for the best, I won't be able to affect a wider change.

Roles and responsibilities are vague on both of the teams I manage.

I'm going to be pulled into some false directions, especially towards engineering processes since it’s easily detected that I’m a software geek.
