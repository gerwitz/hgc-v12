I've started my fifth month at Philips and finally feel like I can affect small changes and seeing opportunities to do more. This seems like absurdly slow to me, but of course I'm still seen as a freshman by most others.

Some personnel shuffles have been resolved, but were challenging enough to be interesting.

Personally, I've been really stressed about cash flow, due to the complexities of our properties in the US. Finally identifying how much this bothers me means I could find a way to address it, so now we have a plan to make at least 2019 more comfortable.

Most importantly, I finished Zelda Breath of the Wild.
