Work is smooth. A recent hire seems to be working out quite well, and I rarely feel like I’m fighting a fire these days. I’m impatient to be working faster towards change. It feels like I’m missing something with how often I’ve been given “just do it” advice when “doing it” requires resources I don’t have.

I worked from home two days while we had an air conditioner installed. (A lot of research went into minimizing our carbon guilt about that!) It was more enjoyable and productive than I expected.

On Saturday I got in one of my [longer workout rides](https://www.strava.com/activities/2470719487) (75 km) and remembered how soft I’ve become but also how rewarding it is to push past comfort.
