I had a quiet day at the office on Wednesday, and it helped me rediscover the value of focus time. I suspect a defining struggle of my time in-house will be balancing the need to keep in touch with many stakeholders while avoiding the trap of treating quick coffee chats as productive time.

My optimism is still high about the new org structure and our leadership. Time will tell, of course, but Iâ€™m hoping to get to building beyond fixing.

The weather was amazing this week, and the long Easter weekend was spent road tripping with friends, riding my fast bike, and strolling a museum. Good times.
