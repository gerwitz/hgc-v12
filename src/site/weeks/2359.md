Work is fine, but the pace of change is excruciating. There is a healthy culture of “just do it and ask forgiveness” here, but to pursue the improvements I want requires resources and mandates that I cannot unilaterally assume. It’s possible I need to be more bold in making proposals, though.

The weather is good, financial stress should be alleviated by the house sale, I have fun side projects (markdown-it-sidenotes and sitewriter).

Yet I’m not feeling comfortable at all. Instead, I’m not sure I’ve felt so persistently uneasy since I stopped worrying about paying for food. Hopefully the next two weeks of holiday disrupt my chi.
