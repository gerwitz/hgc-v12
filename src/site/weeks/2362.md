The Seattle house closed, so now all that equity is sitting in a bank account. Combined with the retirement funds, it looks like a lot of dollars. Yet I don't feel wealthier; converting a fixed asset to liquid doesn't actually change net worth and even brings more responsibility to be productive with it. And the complications of our dual-nation life makes retirement planning feel like gambling. At least now cash flow is a lot more simple and I can budget more proactively.

The first week back at work was tiring only because of the context shifting. Generally, my normal role is going smoothly and the job that's closer to org design is inching forward.

My little bit of Dutch is already rusty despite daily Duolingo during holiday.
