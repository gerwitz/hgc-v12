Looking back at the first half of the year, I’m satisfied (but not impressed) with what we’ve accomplished. At the same time, I am personally struggling to connect our work directly with my passion for making products better. The link is certainly there, and our function is critical, but I don’t _feel_ it because I’m so personally removed from the sort of decision making I used to take for granted.

Recovery is going well, despite the heat wave. Praise to the airco gods for solid sleep.
