Applying Postel's Law for onboarding myself: accept all information, but make no commitments.

Trying a few pinned iCloud Notes, especially a "burning questions" sandbox.

Roles and responsibilities are murky. PMs are doing analyst things, POs are expected by some to be PMsâ€¦

I hate sharing the toilet with men.

Cool things:
Garage bicycle parking
Badge-based printing infrastructure
Subscriptions to Harvard training
