Surgery went well, though the aftermath is not what I expected. (Ever the stoic, I tried not to have expectations, but that’s impossible.) Physical recovery is fine, though I wasn’t expecting the nonlocal effects such as “growing pain” discomforts and weird appetite fluctuations. Emotional recovery is stranger, still. I have zero regret, but there is that sense of loss that accompanies any irreversible change. I’m sure there’s a German word for it. This is accompanied by a familiar disappointment from dental work: if I’m going to go through pain, discomfort, and inconvenience, shouldn’t I get an upgrade of some sort and come out **better**?
