I’ve climbed up one step of the apocryphal Maslow hierarchy at work. Many of the EOY fires are now under control, and my primary attention shifts to normal processes like employee performance reviews. It’s still too rare that I spend time on my strategy, but I can better imagine a calm future.

Personally, this was a week of many old, enjoyable habits making a comeback.

Last weekend was spent in Ghent, where we stayed in an amazing room within a tower just across from the cathedral. The reason for the trip was to catch an exhibit on women painters of the Baroque, and it did not disappoint.

We visited friends for dinner, which has become too rare.

Shannon’s show is tonight, and preparation (moving and hanging) went smoothly.
