I’m in the middle of the mid-year personnel review process, which is exhausting but strangely rewarding. My reports are universally mature enough to appreciate feedback. Even more unexpected, I somehow enjoy how the HR-mandated processes make the work of managing people appear as, well, work.

Another weekend of debauchery with guests awaits, as I’m about to stop work early to start cocktail mixing class. Maybe it’s all the drinking, but I am beginning to feel properly recovered from surgery.
