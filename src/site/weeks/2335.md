The main event this week was the terrible cold that our American friends brought to us in Florence last week.

On Monday I got even more news about how my job will change with the new year, which I'm still processing. Overall, I am pleased to note that my fears of stagnation in a static corporate environment were unfounded.

Wednesday, I went to an event at PostNL that included several sessions in Dutch. I am both emboldened and disappointed by how well I understand simple statements and how lost I am listening to rapid dialog.
