[Plazes][1] has promoted their new version, essentially going from 1.0beta to 2.0beta.  It's very "Web 2.0" in design (except the corners are sharp) and it doesn't look like anything has changed from the private pre-beta test.  The new interface is much easier to understand, with simplified [user][2] and [place][3] profiles.
