[Amazon's Mechanical Turk][2] is one of the most interesting new business models this year.  The concept of a task-completion marketplace is not too innovative, but their model of qualifications and exposure of [web services][3] certainly piques my interest.  Only time will tell if they can fill their chessboard with enough [Schlumbergers][4] to keep playing.
