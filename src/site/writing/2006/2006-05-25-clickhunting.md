[Sebastien Paquet blogged][1] some lessons from [Jared Spool][2].  Besides pointing out that "above the fold" is not as show-stoppingly critical as some believe (but still important, see the "Iceberg effect"), he articulates an important concept in HCI.  Users are seeking a destination (either action or information) and it keeps them happy to reward their clicks with clues that they are getting closer.  I've always used terms like "reinforcing the clickhunt," but I think I'll adopt his metaphor of increasing "scent."
