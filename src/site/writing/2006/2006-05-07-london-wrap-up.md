### Impressions

Central London is clean, approachable, and the locals are more polite and friendly than you could imagine.  Not sure I could stay, though, with smoking being so prevalent and most socializing centered around drinking at pubs.  


### Highlights

  * Bicycle tour


  * Getting out to Oxford, albeit briefly


### Left to do

  * Stonehenge


  * A football match


  * Parliament in session


  * Staying outside the tourist-trodden center, perhaps in an outlying town
