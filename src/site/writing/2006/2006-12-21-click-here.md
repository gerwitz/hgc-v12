In a shameful exhibition of capitalism, [infÅ«z][1] traded [Ze Frank][2] some candy in exchange for a a bling duckie on the [holiday show][3].  The "Click Here" copy is a continuing theme; as an interactive agency we don't know how to cope with static media like duckies.

Or video.  The first of [our video shorts][4] was filmed in my loft.  It's a little creepy recognizing the set, but not half as creepy as the next installment.  Teaser: [Brian][5] makes an appearance in bed, and he's not alone.
