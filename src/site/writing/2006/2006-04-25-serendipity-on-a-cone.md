Yesterday we went to [the game][1] and I learned at the [Ben & Jerry's][2] stand that today was free cone day.  Kristan and I lamented that we don't have one Downtown yet, and has no reason to travel near one.

This morning my calendar reminded me I needed to take the train to the CWE for lunch with [Dave][3] at [Culpeppers][4], right next door to a Ben & Jerry's.

Clearly, the fates intended for me to have ice cream.
