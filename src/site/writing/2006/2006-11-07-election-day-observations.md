The Diebold touchscreen machines are clunky, with blocky, aliased text against a pink background, and the printout is behind a door that most people don't think to open.  Don't you think a few hours with someone who can spell "usability" might have been called for?

I voted mostly in line with [Steve Patterson][1], but I did go to the trouble of looking up the bar association ratings for the judges, and voted against the two of them with dramatically lower scores than their peers.

Tom Chartier, though, summarized [why I'd rather vote for monkeys][2].
