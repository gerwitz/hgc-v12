I suppose I should publish my 2Â¢ regarding the [new ballpark][1], having been to two games already.  I heartily approve.  It doesn't try to be an amusement park or deny the city, but rather simply presents a field with a lot of well-positioned seats, and seems to take just as much space as it needs.  The views from within are nice, but it's really the undramatic transition between inside and outside that makes it feel like a natural part of the neighborhood.
