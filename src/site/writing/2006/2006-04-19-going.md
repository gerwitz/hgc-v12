Go is a strategy game, arguably the oldest played by humans.  
I spent many years thinking "I'd like to play that someday," but after seeing it played in [Pi][1] and [A Beautiful Mind][2] in 2001 finally set to teach myself.  I learned the basics online (at [Yahoo Games][3] and [Sensei's Library][4]), talked a few friends into playing, and even attended a few [public gatherings][5].  
Will and Steve have long since surpassed me, and I hover around 24 kyu on [Dragon Go][6] and rarely win games on [IGS][7].  As I write this in mid 2004, I'm just beginning to realize that I only have enough practice to understand life and death, and do not yet have any of the intuitions I need to grow.  Experience comes from experiment, with quickly-played games.  So, I've ordered some 9x9 boards to keep at home and office and resolve to visit [goproblems.com][8] more regularly.
