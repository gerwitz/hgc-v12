Thanks to [an entry on RSS replacing email marketing][1], I presently rank number one for [Google searches on the quasi-yiddish almost-word "schmush"][2].  Once I figure out how to monetize my newfound power, I can retire.

(Interestingly, my personalized search results place a different page of my site about 40th.  Google doesn't seem to think I'd find myself interesting.)
