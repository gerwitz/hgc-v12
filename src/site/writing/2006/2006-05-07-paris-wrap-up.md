### Impressions


Staying in the 1st arrondissement and spending most of your time within the city dÃƒÂ©partement certainly exposes one to a different Paris than I saw in 2002 staying further out and wandering throughout the grande couronne.  I saw a much cleaner city this time, and since most of the people I interacted with lived off tourism, they were quite amiable.  


### Highlights






  * Walking along the Seine


  * Notre Dame (yes, again)

  


### Left to do






  * d'Orsey (still)


  * The Louvre
