In the ten months from mid-August 2009 to mid-July 2010, I travelled over 91,000 miles in [inter-city trips][1].  That's nearly 4 trips around Earth, and an average velocity of 20 mph during waking hours, mostly via aircraft.

In the three weeks since we returned from our European tour of duty, we're back to a comfortably urban 0.2 mph, almost all by foot.
