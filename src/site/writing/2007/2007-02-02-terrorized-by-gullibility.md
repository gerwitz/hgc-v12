> Public safety officials are all working together. There is no time for anyone to panic. We believe we have the situation in hand. Go about your business.

Two nights ago [Peter Berdovsky and Sean Stevens were arrested in Boston][2] for placing glowing electric signs of a cartoon character flipping the bird.  Seriously.  It was part of a guerilla marketing campaign across several cities, and they'd been in place for a while in Boston before a concerned citizen "took part in Homeland Security" and brought the area to a halt while the police blew up what amounts to a battery powered Lite Brite.

Yesterday they pled not guilty to disorderly conduct and placing, transferring or possessing a hoax device that "results in panic."  They then held a press conference on hairstyles of the 1970s.  

[Phillip Baron says it best][3]: The press accuses of them of not taking it seriously but, in a sense, they're taking it just as seriously as they ought to.
