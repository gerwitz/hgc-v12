One of the amusing aspects of life Downtown are the waves of visitors.  It is often entertaining to guess what sort of convention is responsible for a new wave of similar people in the CBD, and it's usual simple to determine whether the home team won the day's game.  Many crowds are familiar, the Promise Keepers around the arena are a particularly rude bunch, and the cheerleading competitions are disturbing with their waves of blonde mothers living vicariously through their exposed-midriff, exaggerated-makeup 8 year old daughters.

But tonight saw the annual invasion of the cute: the princesses.  A Disney show brings in crowds of families, each with their 3-foot replica of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Ariel, or whoever.  It's like Halloween with an "adorable" theme.
