It was recently pointed out to me that [my LinkedIn profile][1] has grown to 118 connections.  If you asked me to name people I know, I doubt I'd be able to produce a list that long, so I determined it was time to go through and trim those one-time professional contacts that I don't expect to every reconnect with.

I expected to cut about 50%.  I actually identified only 9, and 3 of those were just obsolete duplicate profiles.  Now I'm pondering how to rekindle the handful of connections that I elected to leave active even though I haven't talked with them recently.  One promising idea is to simply run through the remaining list of 108 and offer an endorsement to each.

During this exercise I noticed that a few others had entered headlines for themselves that were more interesting than the usual Current Position at Current Employer.  The winner for best headline is [Ryan][2], the Time 2006 Person of the Year.
