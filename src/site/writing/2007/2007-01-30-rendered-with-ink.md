I don't order books online often.  When I do, they're typically gifts for others.

It's not that I don't read dead trees, I just prefer to browse in a bricks-and-morter store, even though I usually know what I'm looking for and don't need to review before purchasing.  Fond memories of childhood hours spent in the [neighborhood library][1] doubtless contribute to this behavior quirk.

But I seem to be developing a habit of buying books-to-be on the web.  It started in 2005 when I pre-ordered Huw "Lem" Davis's [_Book of Random_][3]; even though it took forever to materialize, I've been tickled pink to interact with [bunny][4] on physical pages.

Most recently, I've taken an opportunity to support the fascinating team at Damn Interesting by pre-purchasing [_"the book"_][5].  It will certainly exceed the digital edition's paper-weighing capabilities, but they've mostly enticed me by establishing a relationship by giving away great content, that they can now monetize via promises of a fleshed-out compendium in a pleasant-to-browse format.

I already pay for John Gruber's [Linked List][6] and I'm sure someday I'll be paying for a movie from Ze Frank.  I've already bought T-shirts from each (and from [Calico Monkey][7])... and in every case I feel like I'm bartering with a friend, not just purchasing product.  This is clearly the future of publishing.
