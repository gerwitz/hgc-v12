I must have slept funny on [the lateral temporo-occipital junction of my left hemisphere][1] last night, because all day I've suffered from the inverse of prosopagnosia.  Almost a dozen times I've turned to a glance of a former coworker, family member, or someone else I recognize but don't see regularly, only to find a stranger who barely looks close enough to serve as a stunt double.

Interestingly, this area of the brain is also involved in binocular alignment.  Perhaps I'm prone to this since I suffered [amblyopia][2] as a child, which was barely corrected in time so I still suffer a [phoria][3] (exophoria if I recall correctly).  I'll have to be more careful with that cortex.
