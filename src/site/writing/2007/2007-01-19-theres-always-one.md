Why must every group have someone who just has to be a contrary asshole?

I don't mean playing devil's advocate.  Or even being skeptical and working against consensus until every detail has been worked out.  A healthy fear of groupthink is valuable.

I mean the guy that has to take an unjustified position of authority and speak loudly on every issue, citing unsubstantiated facts and behaving as if no one else in the room could possibly have thought an issue through with the intellectual depth you provide.  Except that intellectual depth can only surface by raising your voice and using "me vs. them" language.  And you can't look anyone in the eyes while you do it.

Yes, if you're a member of the condo association I'm on the board of, and don't remember if I wear glasses or not, then I'm talking about you.
