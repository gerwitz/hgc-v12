Lunch group brainstorm of the day:
- Superbowl advertising is as much about hype as about the actual 30 seconds of actual exposure.
- The Food Network may have actually sold [subliminal advertising to McDonald's][3].
- Even though [popular belief][4] is largely debunked, there's enough [possibility][5] to convince advertisers that value exists.

So, someone needs to buy a very short Superbowl ad segment and sell each frame individually.  Probably a stunt that would only be profitable once, but who cares?  [Once made Alex Tew a millionaire.][6]
