My completely unwarranted review of Amazon's new [Kindle][1] e-book reader, without touching one:

   [1]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FI73MA/?tag=gerwitz-20

The eink screen's light gray colouring looks ideal, and a bright white would certainly cause eyestrain. But what's with the white casing? It appears distracting, like reading a paperback in a frame that covers the margins in bright white. 

The keyboard is entirely too prominent, considering how unimportant it is to the reading experience. It leaves the impression the device considers searching and purchasing as primary use cases, rather than browsing and... reading. 

Nonetheless, I'm excited about a future the ebooking. Sign me up for a next-gen Kindle that's all screen.
