Two weeks ago I had a hiccup with DNS (old zone got deactivated before the new one was live) and a few caches led to resolution problems.  Amazingly enough, [Feedburner][1] has problems with stuck DNS caches, so this resulted in more than a day of outage for my syndication feed.

Interestingly, the traffic has still not recovered.  I guess some of the random people who'd subscribed got errors in their readers and unsubscribed.
