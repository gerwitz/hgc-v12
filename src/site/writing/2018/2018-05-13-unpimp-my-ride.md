The time has come to replace the tires on my snelfiets[^snelfiets]. The Continental Grand Prix 4000s have been on it for 8400 km (5200 miles) over 14 years! It is very impressive they lasted this long, but besides visible wear I was beginning to feel a loss of grip when cornering on pavement[^pavement].

[^snelfiets]: I should call it a "racing bike" but since I don't race, that seems wrong. Americans might call it a "road bike" but in a land full of urban bikes that's also wrong. So, "snelfiets" (fast bicycle) it is.

[^pavement]: More cross-cultural language fun! By "pavement", I mean paths covered with pavers (bricks), not tarmac made of asphalt.

They were yellow. I loved the aesthetics of this with the Lemond, but they felt more appropriate when I was among the fastest riders in most group rides. Today, thanks to some combination of age, waning commitment, and a different community, I am decidedly average in speed.

So, I now have placed black Specialized Roubaix Pros. They are so boring.
