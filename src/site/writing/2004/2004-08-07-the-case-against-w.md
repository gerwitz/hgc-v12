[Ron Reagan's renown Esquire article][1] doesn't say anything new, but neatly sums up why I'll be voting **against [Bush][2]** at least as much as **for John Kerry**.  [Ryan][3] pointed out that recent punditry treats as an assumption it is "wrong" to vote for Kerry because he is not Bush.  I don't think this is correct: voting is a choice between candidates, not an objective judgment of a person.  Kerry may not be everything I could possibly want in a president, but _relative to Bush_ he can almost do no wrong.

**UPDATE:** Barlow has written a great essay on why we need to support Kerry, even if he's not Prom King material:

> Between his ill-conceived military adventures and the billions his tax cuts have diverted into the pockets of his friends, Bush has created a deficit that may ultimately bring down the world's economy.
