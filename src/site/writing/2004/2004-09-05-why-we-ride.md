It's [that time of year][1] again.  A week from now, I and some friends will be riding in the [MS 150][2], a benefit ride for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.  Over two days (Saturday, Sept 11 and Sunday, Sept 12) we will ride 150 miles.  Some of us are aiming for 200.

The MS Society is an efficient organization serving a great cause.  Besides research into treatment and an eventual cure for the disease, they provide assistance for families presently coping with it.  Please join us by [riding with the team][3], or [pledging a donation in support][4].
