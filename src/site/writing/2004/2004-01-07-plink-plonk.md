Speaking of social network software, he's hoping that [PLINK][1] comes to dominate this space.  Being based on FOAF, it's the only one that's inherently extensible, doesn't try to hide our personal information like it's their own intellectual property, and, get this, allows links to your own page.  Whoa, that's going out on a limb, huh?

I think widespread adoption will require hosting of FOAF files with a simple editing interface, though.  That's one of the many personal projects I've dreamt up that I'll never get to.
