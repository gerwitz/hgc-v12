![Edward's first day](/media/2004-09-02-edward-comes-home/edward.jpg)
On Thursday Kristan picked up her new [Mini Cooper][2], named Edward.  Purple with just about every option (except the turbo, the actuarial tables frown on that), it has to be the cutest non-Miata car I've ever seen.  It's a blast to drive, and now we can move big things
