Got out on the [new bike][1] today.  Felt like I was invincible, and flew up the riverfront trail about 6 or 7 miles before turning around to return home.  Then it hit me, why it had been so effortless: the tailwind, now the headwind.  Coming back was miserable, but I still averaged somewhere around 15 mph (very rough estimate) on the trail.

In hindsight, I should have known something was awry when I could smell the hops used by that [little brewery in Soulard][2] all the way from downtown.
