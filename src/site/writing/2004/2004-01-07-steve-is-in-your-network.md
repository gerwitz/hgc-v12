A recent invitation to [LinkedIn][1] reminded me of the world of social network software, so I visited [Friendster][2]  as well.  Amusingly, the random connection highlighted on login was [Woz][3], from only 2 degrees of separation.  I don't think that gives me the right to borrow a [Segway][4], though.
