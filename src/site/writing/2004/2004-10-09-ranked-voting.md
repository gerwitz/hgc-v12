[Ranked voting systems][1] permit the voter to select multiple candidates, indicating an order of preference.

Although [instant runoff][2] is more popular and [Condorcet][3] is the most "accurate", I prefer [approval voting][4] as a [pragmatic][5] solution that is more supportive of third-party candidates.  (I, personally, would love to vote Libertarian for representative legislators, without feeling I was "throwing my vote away" and giving up the chance to vote against the worst of the available fascists.)
