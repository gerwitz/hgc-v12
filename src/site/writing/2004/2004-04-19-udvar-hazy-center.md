One of Kristan's passions is space exploration, so visiting the Enterprise space shuttle at the Smithsonian's [Udvar-Hazy Center][1] was a must.  Because of the distance from DC, I suspect a lot of tourists will miss this museum; but anybody that enjoys the large exhibits of the National Air & Space Museum owes it to themselves to go check out this gigantic hanger, lousy with aircraft.
