As Saturday's weather did not invite cycling, I amused myself by building a paper sculpture of a [Sumatran Orangutan][1], courtesy of [Yamaha Motor Co][2].  The results were satisfying, considering I found only a dull razor blade and a glue stick to work with.

They have a [wide variety of models][3] for download.  I am reminded of paper buildings I once assembled at my grandmother's, I believe they might have been Geoffrey Heighway models, similar to [Build Your Own Chicago][4] but a bit more [complicated][4].

There are a lot of [models freely available on the web][5].  The Japanese have really taken to "papercraft", with more [corporate site candy][6], [simple][7] [models][8] for children, [lots][9] [of][10] [cars][11] and [robots][12] for bigger kids, and of course [trout][13].  Some Brits have taken it to another level with [paper machinery][14].
