Dana, Curt, Alex and Len joined for a morning ride to Tillis Park to watch a few laps of the [Spring Criterium][1].  Beautiful day for a spring ride, and I'm left with the comfortable fatigue that rewards exercise.  My arms, though, are **sore**.  Partially because I still haven't been fit on my bike (I suspect the stem is several cm too long) but also because I'm just an upper body wimp.  Need to work on that.
