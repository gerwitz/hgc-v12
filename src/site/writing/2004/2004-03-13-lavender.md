Will, Gina, Ryan, and I rode down to join [The Ride][1] on the Hill, where Alex was holding up a crowd of 8 waiting for us to join.  We rode less than 20 miles, mostly meandering toward the river and back to the cars for food.

One story worth sharing (second hand): Will temporarily swapped bikes with Alex, and rode his stylish pink 1970's Raleigh.  When we passed a crowd of mullet-wielding supercross fans outside the Dome, some kids purportedly yelled "He's got a pink bike!" in Will's direction.  In true form, Will stood up and yelled back "It's lavender!"  Classic.
