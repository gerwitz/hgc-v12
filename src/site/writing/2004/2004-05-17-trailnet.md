[Trailnet][1] is a group here in St. Louis that advocates building trails (mountain biking, walking, cycling) and helps fund the establishment and maintenance of them.  They are also the parent organization for the [Bicycle Fun Club][2], which brings together hundreds of cyclists nearly every weekend of riding season for supported rides.
