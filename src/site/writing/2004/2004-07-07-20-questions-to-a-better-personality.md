You are an **[SRCL][1]**-Sober Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you an **Ayn Rand ideal**. Taggart? Roark? Galt? You are all of these. You were born to lead. You may not be particularly exciting, but you have a strange charisma-born of intellect and personal drive-that people begin to notice when they have been around you a while. You don't like to compromise, but you recognize when you have to.
