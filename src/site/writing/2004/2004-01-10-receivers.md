It seems everyone is excited about the [SLIM][1] boxes.  I'm not sure why, when the same money can get you Elgato's [EyeHome][2], which not only receives MP3s, but lets you interact with iTunes, and display your photo library, video, and web pages.  Personally, though, I'm not excited until I can get an [EyeTV
300][3].
