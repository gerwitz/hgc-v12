I want to build a small cabin out of [LiTraCon][1] on the [Kuhlman farm?][2], with a similarly translucent fiberglass roof.  Moonlit silhouettes of the forest canopy would perhaps help recreate a tent-like atmosphere in a more permanent structure.

Another fun use would be illuminated paving.  Especially if the illumination is provided by addressable panels.  [Blinkenlights][3] for plazas!
