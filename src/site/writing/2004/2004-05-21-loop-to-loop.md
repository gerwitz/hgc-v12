Met [Ryan?][1] at the Loop for drinks, then we took a brisk ride around the [Forest Park trail loop][2].  That trail is a known quantity for me, having traversed it by foot and bicycle probably hundreds of times in my life.  This was the first full loop on the new road bike, and I learned two lessons: May really is early enough in the season that you can wear yourself out in 7.5 miles, and using a light road bike lets you do so in a fraction of the time any other method requires.
