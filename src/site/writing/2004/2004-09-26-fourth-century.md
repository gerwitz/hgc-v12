I've finished my third century this month, and fourth for 2004.  Unlike [last year?][1], the weather was awesome.  The wind didn't pick up until after lunch, and only became a strong headwind for the last long leg.  Thankfully, the "Psycling Psychos" in their patriotic garb let me join their paceline, so the wind wasn't too challenging.

This is the first long ride I've used the Camelbak for on the road bike, and it was a mistake.  The extra weight on me, rather than the bike, made every body part that contacts the bike sore much faster and more seriously than the other three 100-milers this year.
