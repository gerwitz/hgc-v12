  * [Suspicious ballot routing][2] in Ohio


  * Strange numbers from [Palm Beach County][3] and [the rest of Florida][4]


  * Correlations between [exit polling discrepancies and use of paperless voting machines][5] are being widely cited.


  * Correlations between [deviation from party registration and voting machines][6]. (N.B. "no conclusions can yet be drawn from this data and analyses.")
