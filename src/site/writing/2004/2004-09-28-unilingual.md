I hate being unilingual, but I just don't seem to have any language-aquiring neural circuits left.  It seems strange, as new computer languages don't bother me at all, but then again I learned the core grammers long ago, and there hasn't been anything dramatically new iteration and branch control can only be described in so many ways.

The ideal Hans would be fluent in multiple languages, or would at **least** still remember the Russian he spoke in high school.
