This trip, I got to take the interior tour of the [Washington National Cathedral][1].  It isn't Notre Dame, but was quite exciting for this armchair architect.  There is an incredible amount of historic detail in stained glass, stone, wood, and fabric; one could take weeks simply taking if all in.  Of note is the window dedicated to space travel, which tastefully depicts the linking of celestial bodies, with a piece of moonstone embedded within.
