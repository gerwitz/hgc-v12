My new toy has arrived.  A [2002 LeMond Tete de
Course][1]:

  * 53cm butted Reynolds titanium frame, carbon fiber fork, integrated [Cane Creek][2] headset.


  * Factory [ITM][3] Mantis aluminum stem, bars, and seatpost


  * Shimano [WH-7700][4] wheelset


  * Shimano [PD-7750][5] pedals


  * [Selle][6] San Marco Era saddle

I don't have road shoes yet, so no long rides.  I've only rolled around a few parking lots to adjust fit.  Still, it's **amazing** how much quicker this 18.5 lb. racing machine is than my older 27 lb. [Trek mountain hardtail][7].  Weight and tire friction just can't explain it all, I guess all that frame geometry and component precision voodoo might be for real.

The saddle has to go, though.  Italians must have pelvises about half the width of mine.  Hopefully I can find a way to test a [SaddleCo][8].
