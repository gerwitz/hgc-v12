John Brockman's "[What's
Your Law?][1]" has garnered quite some attention.  Some of the greatest minds of today have offered their own proverbs and truths; it's quite a good read.  It's also overwhelmingly lengthy, but being stuck home ill over the weekend I read the whole thing and want to save a few gems.

In the off-the-wall category, [Stuart Hameroff][2] tries to [revive Cartesian
dualism][3]:
	The sub-conscious mind is to consciousness what the quantum world is to the classical world.
 Sir Roger Penrose...and I have put forth a specific model of consciousness involving quantum computation in microtubules within the brain's neurons.

while [Nancy Etcoff][4] wisely [warns
against any dualism][5]:
	Instead, of acting in opposition, in nature two forces are likely to dependent, interactive and interwoven; sometimes they are merely two names for the same thing.

[Andy Clark][6] is also [espouses
generalism][7]:
	Everything leaks.

[Edward O. Laumann][8] asserts that [monogomy is
healthy][9]:
	Moderation in levels of partnered sex activity is the mode for the bulk of humankind and is consistent with high levels of subjective well-being.  Low levels of subjective sexual well-being is associated with poor physical, emotional, and mental health.

[Leo Chalupa][10]'s Second Law is [depressing][11]:
	...there is a price to pay for originality and every working scientist knows this is the case.

[Roger Schank][12] explains [open-mindedness][13]:
	The good news is that for some people, failure to comprehend is the beginning of understanding. For most, of course, it is the beginning of dismissal.

[Beatrice
Golomb][14] is a bit [defeatist][15]:
	Everything in biology is more complicated than you think it is...

...which might contradict Gerwitz's Law for science, from someone not noteworthy enough for [Edge][16]:
	**The cause is simpler than you expect.**
and has a corollary:
	**The effects are more complex than you can measure.**
