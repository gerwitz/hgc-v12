A lazy ride this morning from home to the Loop to meet Will, his sister Jamie, her boy Don, and Heather.  Joined them to Brown & Midland, then returned full force against the wind and in the drops.  Whee!

This weekend is the loft tour downtown, so the streets are alive with people the way we all hope to see regularly some day.  I feel like a character actor in a theme park riding up to my building and carrying the bike past tourgoers.  Families, young couples, and empty nesters all have the same "ooo, an actual dweller" gaze.

I feel like I should be handing out brochures or trinkets.

who knows?
