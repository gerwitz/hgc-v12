After a random selection aided by [Sauce Magazine][1], Kristan and I discovered [Soulard's Restaurant][2].  It was a bit classier than expected, but the food was excellent from fried spinach to Kristan's London broil to my creole salmon pasta (creole in more than flavor, salmon with cajon spices is a culinary pidgin).  Highly recommended for dinner.
