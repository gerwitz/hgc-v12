[Dave Zabriskie][1] abandoned the Tour de France today after suffering since the TTT crash on Tuesday, where he lost the yellow jersey.  If he can mature to the mental focus (which Lance is known for but Weener and Rasmussen have been exemplifying this year) I expect we'll see Zabriskie in yellow again.  As [Voigt said][2]: "He beat Lance Armstrong and that doesn't happen very often."
