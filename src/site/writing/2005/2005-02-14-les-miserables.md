Early Valentine's day celebration last night included Les Misrables at the Fox, which was outstanding (for a musical, I much prefer straight theater.)

In particular, [Randal Keith][1] was amazing as Jean Valjean, and the stage production (set, lighting) was perfect in setting the atmosphere without distracting from the performance.  Highly recommended to all.
