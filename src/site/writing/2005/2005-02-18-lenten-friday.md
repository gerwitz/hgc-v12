As I sat idly in the passenger seat on the way home after [Constantine][1] (not as bad as I expected, but certainly a forgettable movie), I noticed a sign promoting a Friday fish fry during Lent.  I briefly went through the anxiety of "that's right, it's Friday.  Uh oh, did I remember not to eat meat today?"

That's only funny since it's been [7 years since I ate meat][2], anyway.
