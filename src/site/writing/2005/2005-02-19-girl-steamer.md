The gang went to a [St. Louis Steamers][1] game tonight, which happened to be quite popular thanks to the start of [Lindsay Kennedy][2], who got just over an entire minute on the field, after the game was already a lost cause.

[D. J. Newsom][3], though, is the man.  Despite the loss, the game was great entertainment, and tickets are cheap.  Go buy some.
