A friend noted today that he couldn't have an attractive woman give him a massage because he'd be incapable of relaxing in her presence.  I noted that my inclination is the opposite: I tend to lack confidence in anyone displeasing-to-the-eye and have trouble trusting men, so after the Tour de Cure I gravitated (platonically) towards an attractive chiropractic intern to relax my neck.
