I took Kristan to the Top of the Riverfront, the rotating restaurant atop the [Millennium Hotel][1] downtown, for her birthday.  I've heard a few reviews that it is an overpriced tourist trap.  I thought the food was excellent, though, and the [view][2] is worth a premium regardless (especially during the [Fair
St. Louis][3] air show).  It's not [The Signature
Room][4], but anything that makes St. Louis feel like a real city is welcome.
