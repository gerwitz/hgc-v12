One of the few times I don't have my camera with me is when I walk to the YMCA.  Of course, that was the case this evening when I spied a wonderful picture opportunity.  Five or six folks were flying kites from atop the Art Lofts building in the twilight, with the moon and City Museum providing backdrop.  When I first noticed the kites, my brain's attempt to make sense of the image progressed from "flock of birds" to "birds of prey hovering" to "hey, the ships are here to take me home" before finally finding an appropriate explanation.  Quite dramatic.  You'll just have to trust me.
