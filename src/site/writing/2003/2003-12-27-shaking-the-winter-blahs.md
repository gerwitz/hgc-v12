Rode the riverfront trail this afternoon to enjoy an unseasonable beautiful day.  The return trip had a ruthless headwind, but the real excuse for my slow speed was being reminded of the important of pre-hydrating (forgot the usual preparatory bottle of Propel) and how occasional stationary rides just don't count for staying trained.

On a brighter note, I also was reminded of the bliss of riding outdoors, the satisfaction of pushing until exhausted then turning to ride back, and the comfortable exhaustion after putting the bike up and showering.  Spring can't come fast enough.

**metrics:**
distance: 21 mi
