Rode up the Mississippi to [Elsah][1] today.  Charming little village with public restrooms and cold water.  The river level is amazingly low below the [dam][2].  I don't know if it's related, but the large barge traffic jam in the Chain of Rocks Canal was a sight.  I also encountered wild turkeys within City limits.
