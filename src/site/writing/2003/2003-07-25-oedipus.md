Tonight my brother and I joined my father to watch old family videos.  My father was thoughtful enough back in the early 80's to convert film to VHS so it survives (albeit not in pristine condition) to be digitized today.  It was quite amusing to watch 60 years of history compressed into a few hours.

Best quote of the night: "Whoa, Mom is hot."
