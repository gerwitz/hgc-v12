Somehow we came to contemplating this deep question last night: what is more enjoyable than eating a brownie.  Our hypothetical brownie, of course, is the perfect texture and flavor for your tastes, and is unencumbered by nutritional guilt.  In other words, the reader is instructed to consider their favorite food.

Clearly, most everyone will list sex as an answer.  But what else?  I find it intriguingly difficult to identify greater hedonistic delights.  I guess that makes [gluttony][1] my second favorite deadly sin.
