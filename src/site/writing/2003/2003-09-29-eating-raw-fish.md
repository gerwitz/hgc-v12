Being only 3 blocks away (how do you measure distance in suburbia?  minutes by SUV?) from [Oishi][1], we sushi-loving geeks often walk over there for lunch.  The price is certainly right (under $8 for a maki roll, three nigiri pieces, salad, and miso) and the sushi is very good.

Still, eating lunch at [Miso][2] on Thursday, I was reminded how much better "excellent" is than "very good."  They may not offer [sushi
at 2am][3], or be the [best
in St. Louis][4], but Miso is the only thing worth parking in downtown Clayton for.
