Great quote from a [great article][1]: "Richard Drew is no stranger to history; he knows it is something that happens later. In the actual moment history is made, it is usually made in terror and confusion, and so it is up to people like him--paid witnesses--to have the presence of mind to attend to its manufacture."

Thanks to [Tanya][2] for bringing attention to one of the most compelling image from the events of 2001-09-11.
