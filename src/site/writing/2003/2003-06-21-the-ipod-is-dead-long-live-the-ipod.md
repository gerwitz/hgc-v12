Gir (yes, I name objects) went insane a few days ago; a total battery drain caused a cycle of odd behavior that quickly degraded to an endless reset loop.  The good news is that it was painless to visit the local Apple Store, declare "it's sick" and receive a new one (which has a brighter, bluer backlight and better contrast).  The bad news?  Despite my repeated public acknowledgments of the foolishness involved, I had used it as my only music store for a while, so many tracks and a lot of organization are lost.

So, I've learned my lesson and will now be a good user and use iTunes sync the way Steve intended.
