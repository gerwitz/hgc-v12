I joined Kristan last night for the release of the 5th Harry Potter book.  It was quite surreal to see a bookstore packed with people, more surreal considering the not-quite-bookish nature of the crowd.

While there I picked up a copy of _[The Electric
Meme][1]_ by Robert Aunger.  It looks to be a serious discussion of memes that will actually expand upon Dawkins's ideas rather than merely riding the hype.
