They must be dangerous if they are not us.  This little [rant against tolerance][1] rests on a cynical premise: any form of [difference in belief or practice][2] must involve a dominance relationship, involving the strong deciding whether to tolerate the weak.  Tolerance is not reserved for the society that dominates the tolerated; rather, it may be freely offered to those that do not threaten.

There is a gem of wisdom here, which is why it's worth noting: "If you do not fear a group of people, you can tolerate their differences."  This is the same meme hiding in [a very
different source][3].  I think the man in the Yeti suit and Michael Moore differ only on whether the fear of difference so prevalent in American culture today is a sign of [weakness][4] or [strength][5].
