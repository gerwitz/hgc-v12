I've been preaching that [this][1] is what the future will look like for years, ever since the first time I saw a simple Flash app that dynamically included server data.  I've always meant to learn Flash, but it's been so "movie" oriented that I never could get enthused.  Finally, Flash gets application (I'm sorry, "Rich \[Internet\] \[Client|Application\]") oriented.

Now, we just need to transparently bind [Firefly][2] to both [SDO][3] and [DataSets][4], and we'll be able to look back at those days we used quaint HTML-rendering HTTP clients for our application front ends.
