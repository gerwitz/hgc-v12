[They've finally done it][1].  [Dave][2] and I have long speculated that an "virus platform" that spread silently but prepare a machine to be infected by plug-ins was inevitable.  Now, Windows users had best hope they don't implement any of the mischievous plug-ins we imagined (e.g. pepper the Office spell check dictionary with misspellings, randomly transpose characters in variable names when copy and pasting in IDEs, etc.)
