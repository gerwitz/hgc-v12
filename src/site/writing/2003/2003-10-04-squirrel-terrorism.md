Last [Trailnet][1]/[BFC][2] ride of the season today, the St. Alban's Ride.  Distances were short, but the hills were ruthless.  Highlights:

  * Burning up a particularly lengthy climb while listening to the click-click-click of a Six Flags roller coaster carrying cars upwards not more than 200 feet away  I turned to a stocky fellow pushing his way up and remarked that the parkgoers sounded like they were having more fun than we.  As I continued onward, I heard him remark "A few more minutes of this, and I'll be screaming like a schoolgirl, too."


  * Near the end, a prolonged descent granted a 40 mph rush.  Which only made it hurt worse when a falling acorn hit me in the chest.  Ow.

**metrics:**
distance: 26.5 mi
average: 16.0 mph
max: 42.1 mph
