Time to step up on my soapbox (a short one, but 160 people end up here daily) for a cause.  Please take a moment to visit [MoveOn.org][1] and educate yourself about the latest moves to consolidate media power.  Simply because you're browsing the web right now, and moreso because you are aware of the weblog phenomenon, I suspect you'll be worried enough to take some action, even if it's of the basic [petition
signature][2] sort.
