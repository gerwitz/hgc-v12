The Konfabulator guys are finally [porting to Windows][1].  I was initially very excited to [develop widgets][2], but lost my enthusiasm when I felt the authors didn't realize the potential of an approachable, high-level, standards-based development platform.  Glad to see they're expanding, but it's too late to beat [Flex][3] to the punch.
