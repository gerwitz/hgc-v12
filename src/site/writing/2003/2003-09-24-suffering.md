Time this week has a [short interview with Lance Armstrong][1] (who, of course, is on my short list of heroes).  In it, he echoes my standard explanation of the allure of endurance sports: "I'm not happy if I'm not doing some physical suffering, like going out on a bike ride or running. First, it's good for you. No. 2, it sort of clears my mind on a daily basis."

Lance is going to be in St Louis on [October 15th][2].
