We just got back from shopping for the [St. Patrick Center Christmas Sponsorship][1], which I learned of through the [Residents Association][2], and I realized I hadn't used my little soapbox to promote it.  It's probably too late this year, but if you live in St. Louis, please consider participating next year.
