I wrapped up _[Consciousness
Explained][1]_ tonight, to make room for new reading list items on vacation.  I am heartily recommending it to anyone who will listen.  It would probably be helpful to have some background knowledge in [sociobiology][2], [computer science][3], and [philosophy][4]. I think, though, it will strike enough of a chord with an introspective reader to encourage pursuit of any missing background understanding.

Here's [Dennett's][5] own "thumbnail sketch":

> There is no single, definitive "stream of consciousness," because there is no central Headquarters, no Cartesian Theater where "it all comes together" for the perusal of a Central Meaner.  Instead of such a single stream (however wide), there are multiple channels in which specialist circuits try, in parallel pandemoniums, to do their various things, creating Multiple Drafts at they go.  Most of these fragmentary drafts of "narrative" play short-lived roles in the modulation of current activity but some get promoted to further functional roles, in swift succession, by the activity of a virtual machine in the brain.  The seriality of this machine (its "von Neumannesque" character) is not a "hard-wired" design feature, but rather the the upshot of a succession of coalitions of these specialists.
> 
> The basic specialists are part of our animal heritage.  They were not developed to perform peculiarly human actions, such as reading and writing, but ducking, predator-avoiding, face-recognizing, grasping, throwing, berry-picking, and other essential tasks.  They are often opportunistically enlisted in new roles, for which their native talents more or less suit them. The result is not bedlam only because the trends that are imposed on all this activity are themselves the product of design. Some of this design is innate, and is shared with other animals.  But it is augmented, and sometimes even overwhelmed in importance, by microhabits of thought that are developed in the individual, partly idiosyncratic results of self-exploration and partly the predesigned gifts of culture. Thousands of memes, mostly borne by language, but also by wordless "images" and other data structures, take up residence in an individual brain, shaping its tendencies and thereby turning it into a mind.

I hope that teaser prompts someone to [buy this book][6].
