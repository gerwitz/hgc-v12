A week ago, I started an experiment by including [BlogSnob][1] (a reciprocal link network) and [MarketBanker][2] (an advertising network akin to Google's AdSense but not as [stupid][3]) text banners under "Sponsored Links" on the left.  I was curious about two things: how many click outs will I get from what I suspect to be a plethora of accidental visitors, and how many click ins would I get from my own placed link.

The results are not terribly interesting yet.  I've gotten 4 visitors from BlogSnob and sent 3 out.  I'm a bit curious why I have served 9059 impressions and only received 1093.  MarketBanker has been running tow network ads, with only 4 click outs so far.

Here's the surprise twist, though: some random [bargain site][4] has signed up to advertise here for a week.  I earn $10 for this placement.  I am officially a paid blogger, now.  Look forward to the upcoming announcement that I no longer need to depend on a regular salary and am taking an early retirement to devote my time to this site and improving my position in the numerous popularity contests out there.
