I've given Kristan an 10GB iPod for her birthday.  Because this is before the holiday in question, I am exercising my right to exclaim "Happy Birthday!" whenever she is using it and the mood strikes me.

This way, the pre-birthday anticipation remains in force it's just that the expectation is of me shutting up rather than receipt of the gift.
