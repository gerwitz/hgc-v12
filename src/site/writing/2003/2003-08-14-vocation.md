Today my younger brother Kurt [reports for duty][1] at the [Society of Jesus][2].  He'll immediately begin his two year novitiate at [Grand Coteau][3] and be largely out of contact with the rest of the world (myself included) at first.  I'm extremely proud of him, not only for the tremendous courage required in discerning this vocation, but generally for the man he has become.  That pride is personal and is not dependent on whether he feels called to complete the decade-long process through final ordination.
