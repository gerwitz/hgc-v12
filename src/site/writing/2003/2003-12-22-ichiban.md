[Ichiban][1] on Olive is a quaint little sushi place. I've only been twice, both recently, and had good experiences, although the usual rolls are a bit small and dull, the premium specials are typically much larger and tastier.  Others who visit more often note that consistency is a concern, but they keep going back, so it mustn't be that much of one.

Still, for the price difference, I'll stick with [Oishi][2] when I just want a quick lunch, and continue leaving Creve Coeur when in search of outstanding sushi.
