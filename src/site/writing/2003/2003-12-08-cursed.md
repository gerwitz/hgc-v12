My Miata today subjected me to unscheduled maintenance for the first time (clutch hydraulic hose burst).  Kristan was kind enough to follow me to the mechanic and let me borrow her car for the day, so I subsequently dropped her off at work.

I hadn't even gotten off the side street for her office before someone at the stoplight confused "R" for "D" and backed into her fender.

I'm going to be driving very, very cautiously today.
