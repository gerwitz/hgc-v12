After more than a decade of driving, I've finally hit someone.  A woman who started to accelerate into traffic then stopped, while I was re-checking for oncoming traffic and, finding none, accelerating and not stopping.

No one is hurt, the damage to my car is just under my $500 deductible, and hers is even more minor.  Still, I feel like a twit, especially since she is 8.5 months pregnant.
