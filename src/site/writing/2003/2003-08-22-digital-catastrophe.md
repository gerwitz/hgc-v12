Last Friday my hard drive crashed.  I had spent some time in the weeks prior discussing how to best back up its contents, as my photo library and email archives have grown too large to readily be burned to CD or transferred over the Internet.

After a number of failed attempts, I managed to get it mounted once (after using my iPod as a temporary drive to install an OS and utilities gotta love Apple's architecture), long enough to rebuild the completely failed directory structure and copy everything critical to a Firewire drive.

So, now I'm living on an old 10 GB drive I installed, leaving a lot of stuff on that external drive.  The TiBook is getting long in the tooth anyway, so I sure hope Apple gets a [replacement][1] out there soon.
