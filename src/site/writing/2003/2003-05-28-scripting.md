[Cedric][1] has me thinking about scripting languages.  I'm already intrigued by all the [Ruby][2] [hype][3], but he's made me reminisce about the speedy development cycle of PHP and ASP.  If [Ruby on
the web][4] can bring back that empowerment without wasting my time with arcane syntax quirks or pre-OOP baggage, then count me interested.  I don't expect to be advising clients to consider a scripting language over J2EE or .NET for large-scale enterprise applications any time soon, but it's probably worth [learning][5] for prototyping and personal projects.
