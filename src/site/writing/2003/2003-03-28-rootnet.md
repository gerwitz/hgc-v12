The trees bloomed today.  Most of them.  All at once, it seems.

When I was a child and had just discovered computer networks (before the word "network" entered the common lexicon), I often mused to myself that the trees might have an Internet of their own, connected through roots, with a few high-latency links via seeds and leaves blown through the wind.

Apparently, they have [NTP][1] on their network.
