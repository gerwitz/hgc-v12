I have finished my first century since high school.  I had enough energy left to run around the [water park][1] (which is surprisingly demanding) but now I'm drained.  The chiropractic student was a godsend, my neck was **killing** me and she just pulled the right way and it was as good as new.

Average speed was 20 for the first 50 miles, then dropped to 18 after 4 miles of steep incline on grated pavement.  Never again will I take smooth pavement for granted.  Later, the heat and neck soreness took their toll and my final average dropped to 16.5, which is consistent with the rest of this summer.  Nonetheless, I think I've earned a [road bike][2], now.
