The [Internet Archive][1] has a record of my first webpage, circa [May 13th,
1997][2].

As previously blogged, my earliest Internet footprint was a [Usenet post][3] on April 9th, 1993.  Far more entertaining, though, is a [thread pondering the impact of an Internet with a VR interface][4], where a response included "I've heard sme very good things about WorldWeb from friends who've demo it, but haven't seen it myself."
