Just yesterday I was amused to note a television commercial (yah, Kristan was watching TV faster than the TiVo could keep up) from the [Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority][1] that was certainly more in line with the traditional view of that city.  That is, not the whitewashed "family friendly" Just-Like-Disney-With-Slots view that they tried on for the last few years.  Apparently, this was part of a new ad campaign that gets [edgy enough][2] that a few networks will only show the spots in late night.

So, I've got to note the serendipity of [BJN musing][3] about the wrath of Las Vegas being unleashed upon a man who used [marketing tactics][4] that embarrass the city.  Maybe he can apply for a grant from the LVCVA to cover the fines the mayor wants to impose.
