The META Group, among others, is warning that [camera phones pose a security threat to
enterprises][1].  (You know, those entities we used to call "organizations" or "businesses".)  I'm afraid I just don't understand what the fuss is about.  Is anyone actually convinced that we can somehow prevent information leaks by controlling communication channels?  Are we going to scan all outgoing email, block instant messaging, ban the use of phones to call outside the organization, and frisk people every evening to make sure they aren't carrying any Post-Its in their pockets?  Why don't we just not let them leave the building, lest they be tempted to go out for drinks with a friend and talk about work.
