Mazda's [Rev It
Up][1] event was impressively done.  I'm impressed at the resources they're putting towards wooing driving enthusiasts.  Unfortunately, we only got two competitive runs, and my second was a complete fiasco (hit cone, slowed for course worker on the track, litter from previous driver flew in my face, shifted up too far...).  Still, my [times][2] were respectable and the [urge][3] has been rekindled.
