I'm coining a new term: Angelspam.  This is for all the viral emails that I receive (mostly via my mother) that promise more than the usual litany of enlarged body parts, wealth without effort, or miniature RC cars.  These are the chain letters that promise to make you or your loved ones feel good, receive the grace of heaven, obtain a chakra tattoo on your aura that ensures you get into heaven, or some other mystic benefit.

They're like guardian angel pins, but much more insidious, because these pins insist you assault everyone you know with copies of themselves, or the angel doesn't get its wings, or something.

If the little angel on one shoulder is telling me to forward junk email to others, what is the devil on the other shoulder going to say?
