The [Wasabi sushi bar][1] is open at 1228 Washington Ave. Despite the uninspired name, the sushi is excellent.  The atmosphere is great, too, especially the chef's enthusiastic greetings and farewells to guests from the bar in back.  The maki rolls are small, but the bento boxes are gigantic.  I'm dying to camp at the bar one of these nights and order the Sushi Okonomi: "You eat much as you can, what ever you want."
