My brother is about to begin a [30-day silent retreat][1], highly structured with most of his time devoted to specific forms of prayer.  Same as the Jebbies have been doing for the past 5 centuries.  I spent some time talking about it with him yesterday.  While I'm not enough of a mystic to talk in terms of "God's grace," I expect it will be an extremely rewarding experience; particularly so for someone like him who is naturally introspective but often unfocused (read: ADD poster child).
