Great quote from [Shelley Powers][1]: "Technology driven for the sake of technology and not the people using the technology will never been anything more than a minor nuisance at best, and a disliked, and unused or incorrectly used technology at worst."

A colleague recently asked me what all the "Semantic Web" fuss was about.  I offered that it was a second attempt at marking up human knowledge in a way that makes it easier for the machines to read.  Editorializing (as always), I offered that it's unclear what will motivate people to add additional markup to their web content to make life easier for [Googlebot][2].  The explosive growth of the [first
web][3] was fueled by desire to disseminate information to a human audience.  What's going to drive the [second one][4]?
