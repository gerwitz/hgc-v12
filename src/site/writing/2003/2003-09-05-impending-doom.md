I leave tonight for the [MS150][1], with a team of 10 (including [Ryan][2], [Heather][3], and [Bryce][4]).  A number of us intend to do century (100 mile) rides both days, so wish us luck.  Big props to those who have sponsored us and the fight against MS, and there's [still time][5] for the rest of you.  ;-)
