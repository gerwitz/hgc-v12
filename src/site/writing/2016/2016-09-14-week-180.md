The weather has been nice, so we have the office open. (And this office **really** opens.)

Occasionally (and always during Tuesday’s lunchtime), carilloneur [Boudewijn Zwart](http://bellmoods.com/) plays an assortment of music on the bells of the neighboring [Westerntoren]. Classics from Bach and Led Zeppelin are in regular rotation, last week we were treated to La Bamba.

Client demands have been light, which is nice because administrative demands have been high. We’ve had one employee incapacitated, an intern start, and have hired two new members of The Artificial.

We have had an unusually strong set of candidates for this round of hiring. Watch for an interesting post from Shannon about that.
