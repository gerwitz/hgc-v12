I recently decided to learn [Processing][1], a Java-based platform for rapid construction of visual software.  Surfing about for example code, I was inspired by [Lukas Vojir's collection of monsters][2] and brainstormed with [Shannon][3] to design one of my own.  You can check them out [in the laboratory][4].
