This slightly-too-breatheless [article on Apple in the enterprise](http://www.zdnet.com/article/handoff-and-continuity-compelling-reasons-for-small-business-to-go-all-apple/) elicited a few conservative comments. Here's a fine example:

> Why are you pushing unprofessional consumer nonsense into business?
>
> A real business is smart to stick to a cloud based office 365 type service with Lync. If walked into a store with hipsters on apple products doing nothing but texting each other I would walk out and go elsewhere.

The "consumerization of IT" is a well studied phenomenon and it's not worth my time to rant about how short-sighted this attitude is. This comment draws my notice, though, because The Artificial could accurately be described as a bunch of hipsters using Apple products to text[^slack] each other. (Because [it beats meetings](http://zachholman.com/posts/chat/).)

In 2015 I'm surprised there's anyone left with these weird tool-specific biases--in fact, I worry (as an investor) that the Apple brand will suffer for having lost the counter-cultural cachet of the Think Different era. But it's comforting to know that our choice of tools still inoculates us from the most stubborn dinosaurs.
