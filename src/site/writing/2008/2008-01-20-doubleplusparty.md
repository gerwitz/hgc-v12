Yesterday, [shannon][2] & friends celebrated her birthday and all things 1984 at the loft with music and video from the eighties and [glowing helium balloons][3].

People began arriving by 19:00, and many did not leave until 2:00.  About 70 cups were left lying about and nearly half of the 200 white and purple balloons had wandered home with guests.
