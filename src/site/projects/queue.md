## Drywriter

[txtBOMBER](http://www.behance.net/gallery/txtBOMBER/406136), but with dry-erase markers and staggered to reduce the "scanline" gaps.

## Abstract Window

A diffuse, low-resolution video wall to create ambient ligthing effects. Probably via [DotStar](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2238) or [NeoPixel](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=88729) strips.

## 1px Huis

Lighting for our attic apartment in the form of a long strip of controlled light.
