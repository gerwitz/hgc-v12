[Konfabulator][1] is a cross-platform app that hosts "widgets" on the user's desktop.  When Apple introduced [Dashboard][2] there was much to-do about whether they were ripping off Konfabulator or merely updating "desktop accessories" with modern technology.  At this time, Tiger hasn't been released and it remains to be seen whether Konfabulator will survive Dashboard.  
In early 2003 I developed a widget to let me track my game status on the [Dragon Go Server][3].  In doing so, I had to work around some limitations with Konfabulator, particularly it's lack of support for cookies when making HTTP requests, and so [Dragon's Eye][4] became a popular reference implementation, with more users downloading it than Dragon Go had users.
