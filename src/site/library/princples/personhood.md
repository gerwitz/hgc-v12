I define personhood in terms of consciousness, which I presently (autumn 2004) equate to the ability to purposefully "re-wire" the self so that later decisions are more in line with a goal self image.  This level of consciousness is _probably_ unique to humans on Earth, and is not developed until some time **after** birth and in some cases lost before physical death.  
This doesn't mean [abortion][1] is free of moral complications.
