This is who I expect to meet on my tour of the circles of Hell.

## First
<!-- Limbo -->

- Tailgating pedestrians
- Officemates who fail to push in their chair
- Fietsers who park their bicycle laterally across the footpath

## Second
<!-- Lust -->

- Umbrella-wielders that take all the room under an awning
- Aggressive slowpokes: Those who insist on being in front at a stoplight, but are slow to move onward

## Third
<!-- Gluttony -->

- Carnivores
- Tailgating cyclists
- Those who carry on a loud conversation across passers by, raising their voices to overcome the obstacle of others' heads

## Fourth
<!-- Greed -->

- Dogwalkers with long leashes that span the path
- Carnivores who gloat about their consumption

## Fifth
<!-- Anger -->

- Tailgating drivers
- Dog owners that allow their pet to soil sidewalks

## Sixth
<!-- Heresy -->

- People who don't vote
- Jim Humble and Kerri Rivera
- White supremecists[^nazis]

[^nazis]: Steve Miller

## Seventh
<!-- Violence -->

- The profiteers of internet-scale ignorance and hate[^media]
  Donald Trump
- Drivers who threaten vulnerable roadway users
- Andrew Wakefield

[^media]:  Susan Wojcicki, Mark Zuckerberg

## Eighth
<!-- Fraud -->

- The Trump svengalis (, Steve Bannon)
- Members of the Westboro Baptist Church

## Ninth
<!-- Treachery -->

- The men with power who will trade the United States federation and its role in global peace and justice for personal gain or religious spite (Mitch McConnell, Orin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, Roger Severino, et al)
- Those who fight to maintain an antisocial status quo with no cause but the preservation of the power they enjoy. [^statusquo]
