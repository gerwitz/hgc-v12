I've transplanted twice, and will keep some explanations here.

In 2008, Shannon and I [left St. Louis](stlouis.md) for [Seattle](seattle.html). Like many ambitious St. Louisians, we had both fantasized about living elsewhere, but we did expect Seattle to become our permanent home.

Our lives there, though, offered a tremendous amount of travel opportunity. So we became much more familiar with the larger world and eventually settled on [Amsterdam](amsterdam.html). It is also worth considering this move as an intentional emigration from the [United States](usa.html).
