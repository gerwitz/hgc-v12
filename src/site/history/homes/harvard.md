title: Harvard Ave

Just before getting married in 2009, Shannon and I moved into a new [townhouse on Harvard Ave][harvard]. It was only 1 km down the street from our first Seattle apartment; we even moved some of our things with only our little red wagon.

As I write this, we've owned it for 8 years but spent less than 4 living there. Those were intense years of designing our home, though, so it stands in my memory as "home".

For our time there the property to the west was still under construction, which meant the sweeping views of the sound and Olympic mountains could be seen not only from the roof deck, but the bedroom.
