title: 'SIC 2011: Post-Opulence Design'
---

I had the opportunity to speak at the inaugural [Seattle Interactive Conference][1] and, looking for inspiration, I settled on an [old tweet][2] as a seed.  The result was a talk entitled "Post-Opulence Design".  There have been many requests for slides and notes, so I [posted them on SlideShare][3], where the speaker notes are visible (including image attributions) but I cannot otherwise annotate.  So here's the deck, a video, and a few links I've been asked about.

3: I got the word "opulence" from [Umair Hague][4].  
4: Douglas Rushkoff came to my attention because of an interest in procedural literacy, but his [consideration of social change][5] has been thought-provoking.  
7: My [job at frog][6] makes me an applied futurist, which has led me to my personal model of economic (business), technological (physical), and cultural (human) forces.  
14: The singularity optimists come in many forms, but most of them rely on acceleration of human capability.  Paul Allen argues that human understanding will be limited by [complexity brakes][7].  
15: The best intro to collapse pessimism is probably [Jared Diamond's TED talk][8] on the subject.  
16: Michael Eysenck's [hedonic treadmill][9] suggests we will always be acting to pursue happiness.  
18: Conspicuous consumption was proposed by [Thorstein Veblen in 1899][10].  Yet it's only recently the ridiculous model of the rational agent is falling out of favor.  
21: If you didn't recognize the little pig farmers, please watch [this commercial from Chipotle][11].  
26: A good place to learn more about both environmental and economic influences that threaten to drag our economy down is the [Post Carbon Institute][12].  
29: For evidence that thought leaders are beginning to plan for continued wealth disparity, look up Citigroup's [consumer hourglass theory][13].  
34: The "rise of the maker" is worth a talk of its own.  I'm fortunate to live near one of the nexuses of  maker culture in [Metrix Create:Space][14], go check it out.  My use of a steampunk image was inspired by a viewing of [Vintage Tomorrows][15] last month.  And if you're not using [Etsy][16], shame on you.  
39: I'm surprised more of the SIC audience didn't admit to knowing their rough [Klout score][17].  
40: [Eudemonia][18] is the concept that started this conversation.  
42: One of the key concepts behind dematerialization is [embedded energy][19].  But as one audience member's question indicated, even "virtual" business has energy costs, so it won't save the future from the material forces described earlier.  
43: â€¦likewise with [ephemeralization][20].  
44: Bonus points to anyone who recognized [Dieter][21].  
45: The deck I stole this slide from isn't available publicly, but Hartmut's thoughts are also expressed in the [Journal of Product Innovation Management][22].  
47: I got this image and the idea of affordable not having to be austere from the wonderful [Atlantic Cities online journal][23].  
49: Sometimes the obvious statements are the sticky ones.  "Gamification at its best is a form of eudemonia" got re-quoted quite a bit on Twitter, amusingly [looping back to Umair Haque][24].  
50: Don't forget to check out [this local project][25].  
51: I hear that the reference to experience boasting led to some great side conversations about whether literacy and education are just proxies for financial wealth, making [Goodreads][26] just a proxy for opulence.
