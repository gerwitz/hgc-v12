## Personal Kit

### Wallet

Around Christmas of 2014, I bought a Framelet from [Matthijs Ariens][matthijs]. It was an experiment in manufacturing and he decided it couldn't be made and sold profitably. But I think it's the best of many, many wallets I've tried.

### Phone

I've been carrying pocket computers for ages, and since 2007 they've been iPhones. Today it's an iPhone X.

### Watch

### Headphones

### Belt

A found a [Bison belt](https://bisondesigns.com/products/30mm-catch-and-release&#8482;-gun-metal-buckle) at REI that's made of stretchy webbing. This makes it pizza-compatible.
