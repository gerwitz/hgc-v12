Accompanied Shannon on a business trip as moral support. It was a pleasure to be “along for the ride” and we happened to be in town for the first night of maskless dance events, with nice weather. Our friend Campbell, from Den Haag, happened to be in town and turned us onto [Marcel Dettmann at Funkhaus](https://ra.co/events/1460702) and it was glorious. We also discovered and revisited plenty of nice restaurants and bars and caught up with Birgit.

It was fortuitous that Jeroen drove down to join, because Deutsche Bahn went on strike and left us with no return train. He graciously drove us back.
