I wanted to try a night train sleeper car for our anniversary trip, both because it seemed romantic and also covid-safe. Shannon chose Munich as a sort of prequel to our return to familiar places, so we had an amazing dinner at TIAN.

Sleeping on the train means we needed only two nights at a hotel, so we splurged on a premium room in the fanciest hotel we were familiar with, the Mandarin Oriental. Weather prevented us from revisiting the rooftop lounge, but we had many amazing meals and enjoyed walking old routes despite the damp.
