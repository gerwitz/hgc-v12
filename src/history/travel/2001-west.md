Colleen and I went to Topeaka for [SCCA](https://www.scca.com/) Solo II Nationals, but on 9-11 we were evacuated from the Air Force base. Vacation time was already scheduled, so we drove to Colorado to see the Rockies, visited Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs.

I vividly recall seeing perfectly clear blue skies from Rocky Mountain National Park with no planes or contrails visible.
