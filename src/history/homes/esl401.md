I bought a [loft][401] in Downtown St. Louis in 2002. It was the height of the housing bubble and turned out to be a poor investment. Nonetheless I am glad to have been a part of a small urban renaissance in my hometown.

It was also a pleasure to build out new (interior) construction to my own specifications. I was doing well financially and went overboard with nice finishes. Paired with a job I later took nearby, it enabled me to ween myself off car dependance.
