The future of my vestigial department was doubtful, and I could really only see more operational management ahead of me with no resources to pursue any of the openings for strategic efforts. So when I was recruited by Design it was an easy decision.

The new role is Global Head of Design Systems, with primary responsibility for the DLS program, and a goal to better define and mature the Design Technologist practice. I'm still based in Amsterdam but will regularly visit my team in Eindhoven and travel to other sites.
