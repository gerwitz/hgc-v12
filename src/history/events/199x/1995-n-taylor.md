After Colleen was injured falling through a rotten porch stair that weâ€™d already complained about, we sued the landlord[^suit] and found a much nicer place back in the CWE. It was only a block away from the [crack house](/history/events/1992-pershing/) but on the nicer side of a gate and in a care-for building.

[^suit]: only for a few months of rent, which they settled for

It was the first time I really felt like I had my own home, and I put a lot of effort into building shelving and other low-cost improvements.
