Mom sold the house to move to Creve Coeur, so we had to leave. Thankfully, we were finding enough work to pay rent, so we moved into a shotgun apartment in Tower Grove South. This was still very affordable at the time.

It was a pleasure to live across from the park, though I remember a miserable heat wave in summer of 1993. We would soak bedsheets in water and wrap in them in front of fans, which worked to get to sleep.
