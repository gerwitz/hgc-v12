Somewhere around the time I was getting married, my parents were getting separated. My father moved into an apartment in the area.

Eventually, my mother would move to the suburbs to avoid the risk of running into him, and end up marrying her boss at the time of their separation. He would meet [Julie](/2020/01/30/julie.html) and eventually marry.

I’ve heard stories to cast either of them as the villain in this story, but don’t see any value in me judging. I was estranged at the time.
