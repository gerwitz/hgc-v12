I finally got myself registered with OfficeTeam as an office temp. I got a few very short assignments doing such challenging work as counting warehouse inventory. Somehow, though, it became clear I was qualified for more challenging work and I was listed for the sister company Accountemps, which led to some assignments that required knowing arithmetic.

In the spring of 1993, one of those was doing data entry at Southwestern Bell. I figured out how to script the work I was given with Lotus 1-2-3. My two-week assignment was completed by a PC overnight. I was rewarded with much more challenging work. For a few months earned minimum wage but learned some basic statistical modeling while occupying the 40th floor window office of an executive on maternity leave.
