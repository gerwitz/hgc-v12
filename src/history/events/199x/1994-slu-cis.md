Being a poor student that lived locally worked out, as I took a job as a student worker in one of the computer labs over the summer. (I also kept the SJI job.)

It was a small lab that existed only so the math & CS students wouldn’t have to walk across campus, so there weren’t any other summer workers. That made me “lab manager”. It was boring so I entertained myself by automating lab management with RevRDist and scripts that replaced administration by student workers. In the process I became an autodidactic sysadmin for AppleServe, Novell, and WindowsNT.

That turned out to be more valuable vocationally than my computer science education.
