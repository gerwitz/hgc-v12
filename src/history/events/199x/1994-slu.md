After the accident, a professor had arranged a medical cancellation of the semester for me. Thus, I did not owe tuition nor have grades on my record.

So I started anew in the spring semester of 1994, this time not taking his precalc course because he insisted I test out of it. I later regretted this, because I had never learned enough trigonometry to be prepared for calculus, and my first calculus course seemed *impossible*. (It was with a notoriously poor professor, Steve Harris. The math grad students offered plenty of retroactive “we could have told you not to take an undergrad course with him” advice, later.)

Thus, I would end up technically passing but having to re-take that course[^calc], my worse academic performance since 2nd grade spelling.

[^calc]: The second time I had a fine professor, Kim Druschel, and it seemed *easy*.
