After being laid off, Colleen and I couldn’t even make the rent in the crack house and were evicted.[^crack]

[^crack]: Really, I should have gotten into the drug trade.

My mother let us move into the house, but would not legitimize our marriage by letting us use a bedroom. So we slept in the living room. We had to agree to hide this from my father, which meant packing up the air mattress during the day in case he came by to pick up anything.
