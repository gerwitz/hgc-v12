The owner of MBE figured out we were [spending freezing nights in the shop](/history/events/1991-homeless) and we had to find a real apartment for the winter. Options were limited with no credit and almost no deposit, but we managed to find a small room in the CWE in a notorious building.[^crack]

[^crack]: My father bought a nice condo on the other end of the same block some years later and it was still the neighborhood crack house. We brought it to the attention of our landlord at the time, and he bought it and fixed things up, making himself quite popular in the neighborhood.

It had cockroaches, leaks, drafts, and dangerous neighbors. But it could be kept above freezing and if I remember correctly the monthly rent was around $120. Despite not finding many hours of work, we were able to pull that off for a while.
