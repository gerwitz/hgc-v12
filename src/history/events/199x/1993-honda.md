Being “rich” with all the student loan money, we replaced the Buick that tried to kill me with a baby blue 1985 Honda Civic wagon. It was made mostly of glass so probably would have been unbearably hot in summer.

It also had a fatal design flaw, so when the timing belt broke the valves would collide with the piston heads, which happened before summer came.
