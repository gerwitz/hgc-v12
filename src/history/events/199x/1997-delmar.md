Our landlord was rennovating another building and asked us if we’d move into the first finished unit, which was large, nicely finished, and at the same rent. The opportunity was because it was on Delmar Blvd, an infamous dividing line between white and black St. Louis. The hospital across the street was renown for their expertise in gunshot wounds. Having a young white couple would help him attract the “right kind” of tenant.

Reputation aside, the neighborhood was far safer than many places we’d lived, so we jumped at the opportunity.
