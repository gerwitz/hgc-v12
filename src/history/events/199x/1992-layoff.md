St. Louis tends to lag behind the nation economically, being slower to fall and slower to rise. So the recession that got Bill Clinton elected was still worsening in early 1992. The owner of MBE had to lay both me and Colleen off and make do with only Jackie to keep the shop going.

It took me quite some time to find work again.
