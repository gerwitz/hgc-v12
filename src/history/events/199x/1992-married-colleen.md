Since I was on a role making bad decisions, I married Colleen as soon as I turned 18.

We didn’t even wait that long, our first ceremony was a Wiccan handfasting, well beforehand. After my birthday was the legal signing at the courthouse. 8 years later we would renew our vows. All of these seemed like better ideas at the time than with hindsight.

To be generous to my past self, it’s easy to understand how I would have been eager to attach to the primary source of unconditional love available. Even though she self-effacingly worried about “holding me back” I had completely lost any sense of destiny and sought social stability above all else.
