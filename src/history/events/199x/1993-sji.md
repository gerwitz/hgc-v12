I fortunately found work that could accommodate my class schedule. It was for a promotions fulfillment company in Mill Creek valley right next to campus; I would ride my bike to class, then walk it down some old access stairs from the Grand overpass to an office within their warehouse. There, I would count coupons for hours.

We unpacked submitted coupons from retailers, counted a sample set and used scales to then validate the self-reported totals. Using green-screen VT100 terminals, of course.

Every one of my coworkers was a black woman, most in their 30s. They were incredibly accepting of me, and the experience of working alongside them definitely influenced my worldview.
