I felt relatively well-off and so when Colleen found a job (grooming dogs) that required driving to Kirkwood, we splurged on a 1995 Mazda Miata (better known as the MX-5). She liked it because it was red, I did enough research to know it was a good deal.

It turned out to be amazing. Reliable, easy to work on, fuel-efficient, and incredibly fun to drive. So when it came time to replace the Nissan, I bought one for myself, too. It was a barely-used lease return 1996 [M Edition](https://www.miata.net/faq/mfield.html) in a deep “starlight” blue. I named it “Vicki” and she became my daily driver and racing companion for almost a decade and 150,000 miles.
