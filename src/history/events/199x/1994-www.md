Working in the SLU computer lab over the summer, I took advantage of the simple (and legal) internet access to learn more about how it worked. Some network geeks on Usenet were pretty excited about the World Wide Web so I joined some of the mailing lists where these new protocols were discussed.[^www]

[^www]: I found the URI/URL idea much more interesting than HTTP or HTML at the time.

I mostly used the text-based Lynx browser, but sometimes used the Apple file server that could run NCSA Mosaic. So when nyx.net enabled an httpd with userspaces, I created my first webpage at `http://www.nyx.net/~hgerwitz/` and included `IMG` tags with GIFs. I donâ€™t think any were animated until Netscape, though.
