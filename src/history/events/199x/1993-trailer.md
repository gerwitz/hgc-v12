Without a car and both struggling to find consistent work, Colleen and I gave up on renting our own place and moved into an Airstream trailer her parents kept in their driveway in Overland (Northwest St. Louis County).

She remained close with her parents and we spent most evenings there anyway, so this was an obvious but, thankfully, brief arrangement.
