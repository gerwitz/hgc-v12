Before leaving my job as a student worker, I had applied for a real, salaried job with CIS. I wasn’t eligible, though, as a degree was required.

After I left, they found the lab maintenance system I’d built too complex and deprecated it. This required returning to manual administration and required significantly more workers. They also discovered that I’d been serving as a consultant to the Math & Computer Science and Foreign Languages departments, and they found it difficult to keep up that service from the other side of campus. My former boss was simply unqualified.

So, they approached me and asked me to come take the Academic Technology Director job they’d previously denied me. Besides some delicious poetic justice, I also enjoyed being able to finish my degree without paying any further tuition and scheduling flexibility for the workday classes I’d had to delay to work full time.
