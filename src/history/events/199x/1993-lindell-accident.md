I didn’t make it through my first semester.

One evening, Colleen had come to pick me up from campus and we were driving homewards; she entered the “suicide lane” to make a left turn, and someone in oncoming traffic decided to use that same lane for passing, quickly.

Both cars were totaled, and the other driver and Colleen both suffered predictable neck and back injuries.

The seatbelt in our junkyard-rescued Buick failed to latch. While it kept me from flying completely into the dashboard, it did not prevent my head from smashing the windshield. The only vivid memory I have is a paramedic patiently explaining that I had picked up the wrong glasses and that mine were broken.

I only spent one evening in the hospital for observation, but suffered migraines routinely afterwards. They subsided over time, only reaching the point I would stop panicking about onset signals after several years.
