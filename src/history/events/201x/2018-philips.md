With the winding down of The Artificial, I started poking around for other opportunities for income. A VP at Philips that I respected responded with a great opportunity to build a product management practice around connected devices; pretty much a perfect fit for my experience. It’s good to get some exposure to “in house” after spending my life in consulting.

She left the company before I started and the opportunity wasn’t what she sold me (in good faith, I believe), so I struggled a bit to find my place.
