The frog office manager who arranged our apartment had lost track of timing and was as surprised as we were when our rental on Prinsengracht neared its end. So on short notice and sigh unseen, she arranged a new one for us, near the office.

It looked better in the photos than in person, and was clearly a bachelor pad that was often rented to pot-seeking tourists. It was spacious, though, and relatively affordable which came in handy when we took over the rent ourselves in March.
