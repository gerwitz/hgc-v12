We had our long-term apartment, my travel to Mumbai was a manageable routine, and we were feeling quite at home in Amsterdam. So it was time for Shea to join us.

I looked into how to have a cat "shipped" and the costs were ridiculous. It was cheaper to offer the coworker who was catsitting for us a round trip to come visit, so that's what we did. The optics of having a junior colleague bring our cat to us ruffled some feathers, but it was the cheapest option and there certainly wasn't any coercion involved.

The flight wasn't full, so Shea got her own seat for the trip and handled it much more gracefully than the move to Seattle.
