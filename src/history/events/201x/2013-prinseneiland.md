The apartment on Nova Zemblastraat always felt temporary. Though it was very large, having just one floor felt constrained and the location was boring.

We were very fortunate to find this place on Prinseneiland, a charming area just across the rail line from the bustling Haarlemmerbuurt. It had been renovated circa 1980 so was new enough to be low maintenance even though the building was a storehouse from the 17th century. Our landlord was friendly and happy to let us personalize a bit.
