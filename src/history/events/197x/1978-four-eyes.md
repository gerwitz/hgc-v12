My mother correctly sensed that my vision was not great, and her father was blind in one eye due to untreated amblyopia. So after many attempts to convince the pediatrician she unilaterally took me to a specialist who thought I was long overdue for treatment.

I started wearing glasses, and also an eye patch. It would occasionally alternate sides, while correcting to a balance so neither eye grew too dominant.

The patches were not pirate-cool and the glasses were thick. You can imagine how gracious my peers were in these years.
