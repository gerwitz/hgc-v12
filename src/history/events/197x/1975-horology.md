My first word was _clock_.

I’m not sure when it was, but reportedly I was slow to start speaking. Friends of my mother politely offered their condolences for her slow child.

But eventually there was a breakthrough and I transitioned from quiet with few words to making complete sentences. Apparently I became chatty. An oft-told story recounted me replying to “why do you talk so much” with “I have a lot to say.”

This version of me can still be met over a number of cocktails.
