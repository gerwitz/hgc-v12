My family moved into a nice house in Ferguson, Missouri. This is a suburb of St. Louis that originally had grown from its own train stop on the January-Wabash line. Thus, it felt more like a small town of its own than an extension of the city (like the inner ring suburbs) or bedroom community (like the newer ones). Mine was a very Bradburyesque _Green Town_ environment.
