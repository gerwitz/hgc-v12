I started my 9 years of schooling at [Sts. John and James](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/520236194428927724/) with kindergarten. Our class was pretty stable from then until 8<sup>th</sup> grade and small, never even twenty pupils, and mostly girls.

My best friend, Zachary, who did not return for first grade. This left me a disconnected outcast and put me on the "loner" social track for 8 years.
