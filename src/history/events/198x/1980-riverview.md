In 1980, my father sold Riverview Pharmacy, the corner drugstore he had inherited from his father. My memories are not crisp, but it was a managerie of sights and smells. There was even a seperate, staffed candy counter. It was probably for the best that we did not live close enough for a six year old to walk.

Dad changed careers to financial services, but eventually returned to pharmacy.
