My father managed to survive 3 years after diagnosis, much longer than expected. He stayed well long enough to take Kurt and I to [Germany](/history/travel/2002-europe/) and [Italy](/history/travel/2004-italy/).

It felt like fate that he passed before having to watch Katrina devastate the city he loved.

I expect revisiting [my thoughts from that day](/2005/07/11/fatherless.html) will always be hard.
