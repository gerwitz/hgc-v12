In April 2006, I proposed to Kristan during a fairy-tale trip to Europe. But we put off the wedding until October 2007. In July 2007, we'd just started making arrangements. Nothing felt wrong, per se, but it all felt _romcom_ in a way that was more authentic to her than me.

That doubt made itself undeniable when I kissed Shannon while Kristan was away on a business trip. We were set for a short roadtrip for the wedding shortly after, and the "this is not movie" sensation became unbearable. So I ended it.
