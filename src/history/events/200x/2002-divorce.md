Getting divorced was surprisingly easy, we simply made an agreement and filed it. By disappearing without notice, having no grievances to speak of, and leaving for another state, Colleen knew she had pretty much given up any rights. Yet I was eager to reset my life, so let her and her new boyfriend come with a trailer and take nearly everything from within the house. In exchange, I kept the equity in the house, which turned out to be larger than expected. We didnâ€™t have much cash in the bank so splitting it was not a big deal, I had been saving mostly to a 401k and kept that.

She took her Miata (her second, now a 2nd-gen in black), I kept mine, and we had a third that her adopted brother had defaulted on after we co-signed. That, she and new beau agreed to take but make the payments on. This would lead to a different story, later.
