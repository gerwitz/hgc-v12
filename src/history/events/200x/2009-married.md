Shannon had expressed a lot of interest in some unique jewelry, so [in January](/2009/01/15/euphoria.html) I snuck off and bought her a ring and proposed at [Plymouth Pillars](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plymouth-pillars-park).

We held the ceremony and reception in the since-renamed "Chinese Room" which, as you can read on [the Smith Tower Wikipedia entry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Tower#History), was an ideal wedding location. It's not large enough for a typical "every cousin" American wedding, but we preferred intimate anyway and all of our family lived thousands of miles away.
