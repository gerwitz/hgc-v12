I started at frog (before they dropped the "design" from the brand name) shortly after the Seattle studio had been founded, to establish the technology team there. The office was in a temporary place on Dexter alongside Lake Union, but quickly moved to the heart of Downtown.

It went well, and I found myself living the global consultant life quickly.
