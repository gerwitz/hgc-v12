I sold the Miata, in stellar condition[^condition], to Kurt and didn't replace it.

[^condition]: The condition is only noteworthy in contrast to her future in my brother's hands.

To be honest, I was only car-light. Kristan had moved in with me and bought a MINI Cooper, so we were a single car household. But I walked to work, had most of what I needed in the neighborhood, so got to pretend I was truely urban.
