I didn’t want to live in “our” house any more and needed to sell it, but the loft I wanted Downtown kept being delayed. Meanwhile, Andrew was living in a Downtown loft but his wife wanted to have horses so they had bought a big ranch house out in the countryside but weren’t using it yet. He let me squat in it for covering the cost of utilities.

This is not as extravagant as it sounds, as it was really, really out in the country; it took 90 minutes to get to or from work. I was really trying to socialize, so I pretty much spent every workday driving, working, eating with friends, and driving for 3 months.

Thankfully, it was convertible-top-down season and those Ozark mountain roads were quite fun to drive.
