In March, Shannon was fed up with her job, and talked about finding another. Mine was fine, but I was bored, so we thought maybe we should both look around. And we might as well, then, consider leaving St. Louis.

We decided to look for opportunities in San Francisco (because economy) and Seattle (because we'd both been there and loved it). As seems to be a theme in our lives, the lark became a real adventure faster than we imagined possible. In April I flew to Seattle twice for interviews with frog, in May I recieved an offer, and in June we moved into an apartment on Capitol Hill.[^CHS]

[^CHS]: Online research would have suggested Belltown, Downtown, or Ballard, but during my second interview visit I explored the city and picked Capitol Hill because it felt right.

I broke a commitment to myself to not cohabitate for a year, but YOLO. We [made an epic road trip of it](/history/travel/2008-seattle-move/) and her parents flew out with her cat, Shea, two weeks later.

I was [quite happy](/2008/11/02/the-greening.html) with our new home.
