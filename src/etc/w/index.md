![Presidency for Dummies][2]

This page, created during the 2004 Presidential election campaign, serves as a repository of notes I refer back to when I'm asked "Why do you think Bush has been such a bad President?"

### manipulation of public sympathy to support preconceived actions

> Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.
