> 
> You are an **[SRCL][1]**-Sober Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you an **Ayn Rand ideal**. Taggart? Roark? Galt? You are all of these. You were born to lead. You may not be particularly exciting, but you have a strange charisma-born of intellect and personal drive-that people begin to notice when they have been around you a while. You don't like to compromise, but you recognize when you have to.

> You care absolutely nothing what other people think, and this somehow attracts people to you. Treat them well, use them wisely, and ascend to your rightful rank.

The mid-range "Wackiness" score borders on [WRCL][2], which has a very different description (golden god).

> You are a RPYG-Reserved Practical Physical Giver. This makes you a [1950s Parent](http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better%2BRelationship&page=6&xr=0&ps=10&yi=10&tg=10&key=show)

> You are relentlessly patient, loving, generous and devoted. You are unflappable. If on some rare occasion you do raise your voice or say a swear word in anger, anyone around to hear it will remember it (and think it was funny). At the same time, you're very cute and charming, and even if you don't catch someone's eye at the beginning of the night you'll surely have their attention by the end.
>
> Your calm, conservative nature conceals a passionate (and sexy!) heart.
>
> You can have trouble bringing up problems, but your approach to conflict is calm and even-handed. The problem can be is that you are so busy worrying about your partner's satisfaction that you don't ensure your own. This can build up over time and make you restless. Despite your sexual nature, you are more likely to cheat emotionally than physically.
>
> You tend to work out your frustrations in the bedroom. Depending on your partner, this can be an excellent strategy. You would be a great candidate to balance out an XSYT, but not a good match for an unappreciative RPYT.
>
> You have an odd, ritualized vice that doesn't suit the rest of your persona -- like smoking a certain brand of cigarettes or drinking a certain kind of wine.
>
> Of the 190365 people who have taken this quiz, 4.8 % are this type.

Several MBTI tests have rated me an INTp, although I've never taken the official [Myers Briggs](http://www.knowyourtype.com/).  Over time, I've moved from extreme Introverted to only mildly Introverted, but the other measures have been stable.
