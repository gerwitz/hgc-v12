I score solidly in the corner of [Idealism ][1] quadrant of the [Environics "Fire and Ice" social values
assessment][2].  (Found via [Dave
Pollard][3].)

I wonder if this might correlate to [The Political Compass][4], where I have been centering over time ([2002-01-19][5], [2003-07-14][6], [2003-10-12][7], [2005-02-04][8]) but in no danger of falling [left][9] or [right][10].  Multiple [Nolan scale][11] tests have placed me near 100% personal and 60% economic self-government, which I also suspect would correlate to the compass.

My 2005 [F-score][12] is 1.66, which makes me "a whining rotter."
