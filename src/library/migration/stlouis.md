title: Leaving St. Louis
---

St. Louis is a fine place. I love the city and cared deeply for the history and diversity of people. But I have wanderlust and a deep desire to broaden my perspective with experience. I am not wired to spend my life in the city I happened to be born into.

I also had some selfish itches for better:

- economic opportunity
- weather
- global connection
- cultural significance
- progressive values
