So far I'm only collecting research done by others.
**Gerwitz**
My fraternal grandfather's line has been thoroughly researched by [Ellen Gerwitz][1] and ties in to some other extensive histories including [Gentner][2].
**Kuhlman**
My father says his mother's line is well researched and has referred me to a cousin.  There's a book out there somewhere (_Maryland Catholics_?) that reportedly traces the line back to immigration to Baltimore via the ships The Arc and The Dove back all the way through [Sir Thomas More][3].
**Rasch**
This is my maternal grandfather's line.  I have some notes written by my uncle that I've transcribed to GED.  They cover a wide and deep span, yet are sparse on information beyond names.  Much more work to be done, here.
**Davidson**
My mother was sent a detailed document by a member of her mother's line that is rich with information, including a great story about my great-great.  I've transcribed it into GED and found it covers over 250 individuals back to one of my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers.
