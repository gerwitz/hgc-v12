Just some notes here, for now:

John Barrow: "Any Universe simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind able to understand it."  
George B. Dyson: "Anything simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to behave intelligently, while anything complicated enough to behave intelligently will not be simple enough to understand." [http://www.edge.org/q2004/q04_print.html#dysong][3]  
Irene Pepperberg: "Any behavior exhibited by young children that is taken as evidence of the early emergence of intelligence will, when subsequently exhibited by nonhumans, be interpreted by many humans as a set of simple stimulus-response associations lacking cognitive processing, whereas the stimulus-response explanation will rarely be used to re-interpret the behavior of the child."  
Seth Lloyd: "The universe is a quantum computer: life, sex, the brain, and human society all arise out of the ability of the universe to process information at the level of atoms, photons and elementary particles."  
Colin Blakemore: "The only form of intelligence that really matters is the capacity to predict."
