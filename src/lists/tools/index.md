## Personal Kit

### Wallet

Around Christmas of 2014, I bought a Framelet from [Matthijs Ariens](https://www.demeneer.nl/). It was an experiment in manufacturing and he decided it couldn't be made and sold profitably. I think it's the best of many, many wallets I've tried, though.

### Phone

I've been carrying pocket computers for ages, and since 2007 they've been iPhones. Today it's an iPhone 11 Pro.

### Watch

Apple Watch (Series 4)

### Headphones

Both Airpods and Powerbeats Pro

### Belt

A found a [Bison belt](https://bisondesigns.com/products/30mm-catch-and-release&#8482;-gun-metal-buckle) at REI that's made of stretchy webbing. This makes it pizza-compatible.


## Work

MacBook (13")

iPad Pro (11") is increasingly my go-to workstation.
