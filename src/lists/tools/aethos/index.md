title: 2022 Specialized Aethos
---

In 2022 I finally joined the modern era and bought a carbon-framed road bike: a 2022 Specialized Aethos. The [reviews](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/reviews/bike-accessories/specialized-aethos) were quite convincing, describing it as "for riders who prioritise handling and ride quality above aerodynamics" and that's me!

I enjoy distinctive style, but was partly attracted to the classic appearance. So I opted for the S-Works frame which in 2022 was the only way to get a subtle colorway. Mine is "Cool Grey/Chameleon Eyris Tint" which means grey with an almost lavendar irredescence if you look closely under sunlight. I would have preferred the brushed silver of the "Founders Edition" but those are made of unobtainium.

I prioritized contact points: [Kaptein Tweewielers built it](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cgn_drUI5d6/) for me with Ultegra components, Mavic Cosmic SL 32 wheels, and Specialized's fanciest saddle and integrated handlebars.

According to my bathroom scale, it weighs in at 7.1 kg. I certainly don't need a bike this light, but it feels good to ride and is very convenient to carry.
