Stuff I find important enough to reference or recommend:

## Digital

This site's stack:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to serve
- [IndieKit](https://getindiekit.com/) to post, indyweb-style

[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)

[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)

## Hardware

- 2022 M2 MacBook Air (14" M1 MacBook Pro at work)
- 11" iPad Pro is increasingly my go-to at both work and home.

## Carry Kit

### Wallet

Around Christmas of 2014, I bought a Framelet from [Matthijs Ariens](https://www.demeneer.nl/). It was an experiment in manufacturing and he decided it couldn't be made and sold profitably. I think it's the best of many, many wallets I've tried, though.

### Phone

I've been carrying pocket computers for ages, and since 2007 they've been iPhones. Today it's an iPhone 13 Pro, which is too big.

### Watch

Apple Watch (Series 4)

### Headphones

Commuting and calls: Airpods Pro
Sport cycling: Powerbeats Pro
Inflight plugins: [Urbanears Kransen](https://headfonics.com/2013/11/the-kransen-iem-by-urbanears/) (sadly discontinued)

### Belt

I found a [Bison belt](https://bisondesigns.com/products/30mm-catch-and-release&#8482;-gun-metal-buckle) at REI that's made of stretchy webbing. This makes it both vegetarian and pizza-night-compatible.
