epitaph: finds the world amazing

Some discoveries in life continue to amaze me long after the initial reward.

- Emergence
- Particularly, [plants](/2011/03/06/seeds-of-assembly.html)
- How much water or electricity a surface can store
- Science, which can move humanity forward despite our meager individual cognitive capabilities
- How young human cultures are
- How short modern history is (e.g. the Bayt al-Hikma was founded in the 8th century)
