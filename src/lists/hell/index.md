This is who I expect to meet on my tour of the circles of Hell.

## First
<!-- Limbo -->

- Those who fail to push in their chair
- Those who park their bicycle laterally across the footpath

## Second
<!-- Lust -->

- Those who confuse their pleasure for rightousness

## Third
<!-- Gluttony -->

- Those who carry on a loud conversation across passers by, raising their voices to overcome the obstacle of others' heads
- Those who consume flesh

## Fourth
<!-- Greed -->

- Those who needlessly take more room than others[^big]
- Those who disclaim the behavior of their pets or children
- Those who insist on being in front, yet are slow to move onward

[^big]: E.g. manspreaders, long-leash dog walkers, urban golf umbrella carriers

## Fifth
<!-- Anger -->

- Those who willfully encroach[^encroach]

[^encroach]: E.g. tailgating drivers

## Sixth
<!-- Heresy -->

- Those who hold opinions but do not vote
- Those who seek fame with dangerous falsehoods[^quack]
- Those who consume flesh yet claim to be environmentalists

[^quack]: E.g. Andrew Wakefield, Jim Humble, Kerri Rivera

## Seventh
<!-- Violence -->

- The profiteers of internet-scale ignorance and hate[^media]
- The manufacturers of public consent and direct maniuplators of government representatives, supporting the aggregation of power[^lobby]
- Those who threaten the vulnerable carelessly[^drivers]
- Those who preach that different is dangerous[^nazis]
- Those who advocate for war or destruction[^hawks]

[^media]:  E.g. Susan Wojcicki, Mark Zuckerberg
[^lobby]: Clem Whitaker, Leone Baxter, Edward Bernays
[^drivers]: E.g. a large proportion of American motorists
[^nazis]: E.g. Steve Miller, Donald Trump, members of the Westboro Baptist Church
[^hawks]: E.g. Steve Bannon, Aleksandr Dugin

## Eighth
<!-- Fraud -->

- Those who use power for personal gain or (religious) spite[^spite]
- Those who work to provide the preachers of the 7th circle platforms to spread their message.[^statusquo]

[^spite]: E.g. Mitch McConnell, Orin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, Roger Severino, the Kochs
[^statusquo]: E.g. Joel Kaplan, Mikki Willis

## Ninth
<!-- Treachery -->

- Those who mobilize revolution not against real tyranny, but against inclusive, just society under the flag of "freedom"[^patriots]
- Those who use the power of storytelling to please power to the detriment of society[^svengali]

[^patriots]: E.g. [Mike Vanderboegh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Percenters), [Elmer Stewart Rhodes](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/elmer-stewart-rhodes-0)
[^svengali]: E.g. [Aleksandr Dugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin), Steve Bannon, [Chris Rufo](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-left-urbanists-want-to-remake-your-city-11566512564), [Much of Fox News](https://www.wired.com/story/fox-news-is-now-a-threat-to-national-security/)
