This week I'm excited about process on several fronts at work. The "User Science" practice is taking shape (thanks to bringin Alorah on board), the Open Design working group really seems to have a mission (I probably should have been more prescriptive for speed, but keeping ownership in context is important), and I feel good about the feedback loop from our employee engagement survey helping me prioritize OKRs.

A lot more work ahead, but I _feel_ so much progress.

It was also [busday](/2009/02/23/bus-driver-appreciation-day.html), which our pedestrian lifestyle doesn't give us much cause to celebrate. But a tireless operator from SF [advocated intensely](https://www.kqed.org/news/12031268/sf-muni-is-struggling-to-help-this-driver-wants-you-to-ride-the-bus-and-say-thanks) for it this year, and [included a photo from our wedding on his site about it](https://www.sftransitoperator.day/who-are-transit-operators/history-of-transit-operator-day). It's gratifying!
