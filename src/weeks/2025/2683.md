In the future, I might wonder about the missing 11 weeknotes (weeks [2671](/weeks/2671/) through [2681](/weeks/2681/)).

Despite the dream of "taking it easy" after Canonical, my productivity drive took over. This had a downside and I think it'd be fair to say I got a bit depressed not having a "job" to do. I did write a bit about it, but those words aren't for posterity.

It also had an upside as I really put a lot of attention into [Hexmap](/projects/hexmap/). So, I might say the devlog entries for those weeks are the weeknotes.

I also spent quite a lot of that period [talking to Quillbot](/logs/events/2025-quillbot/), which I didn't care to write publicly-viewable notes about.
