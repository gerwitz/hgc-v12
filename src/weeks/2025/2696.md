On Friday we finally finished the transaction and bought the house. Twice, we have already showed it to friends, which makes it feel real. But oh boy is there a lot of work to do before we can move in.

Somehow, this is the first week I stopped feeling "new" the majority of the time at work. I'm connecting dots, feeling like I can add value outside my own team and beyond that of fresh eyes.
