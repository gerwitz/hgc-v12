It's still Mardi Gras!

Though I worked 4 days this week. I didn't get nearly as much accomplished as I'd hoped the time-shift would enable, it was very productive in catching up on some backlogs. Most importantly, despite traveling for three weeks, I won't fall too far behind.

I'm writing this early, but so far all the parade-going has been fun and as ever I am impressed by hospitality.
