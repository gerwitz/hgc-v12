I met another contractor for the new house on Tuesday, and signed to sell our current house on Thursday. So, my head was mostly in property land. But it was a good work week with some candidates moving through the hiring pipeline, and my new rituals finding a groove. And I got talked into going to an industry meetup…I guess I’m proud of my introvert self for doing it?
