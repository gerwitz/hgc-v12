I tried to call my mother to wish her happy birthday, and was never able to get through. She uses a landline (has a cell she rarely turns on) and takes it off the hook while resting to avoid telemarketers. I am under the impression that as a pensioner in Florida, she probably has a dozen Medicare scammers calling every week.

So, I can only assume she neglected to put the phone back on. But when she doesn’t reply to email, than I really have no way to know she’s alright, without escalating to calling neighbors. It’s a bit stressful.

Also stressful is the glacial pace we’re making towards renovation work on the new house. I’m waking up in the middle of the night, every night, with a new worry that we’re going to run out of time or money.

But work was good, with two promising interviews for important roles in the team.

And Thanksgiving was nice. Instead of creating a giant feasting event, we treated ourselves to a nice night out at the Waldorf.
