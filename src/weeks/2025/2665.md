I shared the news of my departure (and the elimination of my role) with the department this week. I've found myself consistently answering the flood of questions about my own well-being with a general description of the _cocktail of emotions_ such a change comes with. As I write this, there's a fair amount of anger and a lot of guilt over not seeing through the next 6 months. I really expect Canonical Design can "come out" and start influencing the community before this year is over, though there is still much to do before that's really backed up with maturity. If I was better at managing upward, I'd be able to play a big part in that. I even flatter myself to think it will be slower without me.

We also went to an open house on a lark, and fell in love with a property we can not afford.
