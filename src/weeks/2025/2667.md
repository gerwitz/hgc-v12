I’ve begun a bit of networking and even submitted my CV to two places this week. The market seems promising, and I’m fortunate that I can afford to be picky and wait for something I’m excited for. At the moment, it’s hard to really feel excitement with so many loose ends in my “work brain”.

I cope by coding, so am making a lot of progress and even got rapid approval from Strava to use their API with other users.

And I cope by riding, but on Wednesday [Ryan tried to kill me](https://www.strava.com/activities/14260576530) so I’m recovering.
