The week in Bengaluru has been great. I’ve spent time in the room coding as expected, but also gotten a reasonable amount of walking in and shared meals with 3 friends and a future coworker of Shannon’s. I’ll write more in the [travel notes](logs/travel/2025-bengaluru/).

Hexmap has been a lot of work that I didn’t plan for, as I finally got fed up with some database limitations and am transitioning to a new approach before I start adding emails.
