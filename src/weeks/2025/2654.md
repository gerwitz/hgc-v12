All-but-completed another key hire for the team this week, and another starts tomorrow. So the post-holiday optimism continues. Even better, my calendar is pretty calm so catching up on the holiday applicant wave hasn’t been overwhelming and I anticipate being able to really sit and focus in the near future.

I’m pleased to see the good habits that I gained (and Shannon maintained) over holiday continue. The temptation to go dive into my RSS reader or Bluesky has been replaced with a drive to write more code. And if I keep up this pace with indoor cycling, I will feel very good about the outdoor season.

But, let me not kid myself, Mardi Gras is coming.
