Work left me with little energy this week, so I made no progress on Hexmap.

I did finally join a group ride on Sunday, but I misremembered the schedule and showed up for the fast group. The weather was great and legs were fine, but I just [didn't have the lungs for that](https://www.strava.com/activities/15490434388).
