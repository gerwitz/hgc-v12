Writing this a day early because on Sunday we fly to Mardi Gras already. This trip really snuck up on me and I feel almost nervously unprepared. This is not a familiar feeling.

Busy week of coordination at work, with planning meetings and trying to prepare for holiday. I'm very glad to be onboarding a new manager for research and measurement; it's funny to reflect on how my attitude towards research in design has evolved in different contexts.
