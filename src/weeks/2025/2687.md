I'm in the airport heading to India for work. The week has been both uneventful and crazy, as we wrap our heads around buying a house and moving both home and atelier.

Work is going well but I still don't have much rhythm. So I'm barely stealing time to exercise and have no attention for Hexmap. Need to resolve myself to not being "normal" again until Easter, I think.
