Tomorrow (Monday) we will fly to Bengaluru. Shannon scheduled her business trip to correspond with mine, and since I won’t be on mine she invited me to tag along. I’m not sure if I’m looking forward to it, but it will certainly be healthier than staying lone at home.

Highlight to the week for me was inviting Shannon and Ryan to be the first users of Hexmap. It’s spartan, and the first signup did not go smoothly, but it helped me iron things out and is now humming along with Strava and Foursquare integration for 3 users. My mindset has definitely shifted from “scratching my own itch to consolidate data” to “design and build a product others enjoy”.
