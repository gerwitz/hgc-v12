Highlight of the week was [SAIL](https://www.sail.nl/) on Friday, when we celebrated our anniversary with a cruise on the [Catharina van Mijdrecht](https://www.catharinavanmijdrecht.nl/). Exactly how we spent the same day in 2015, except this time we were celebrating our 16th anniversary rather than our 6th, and invited some friends to join.

As ever, boat-drunk is a special kind of drunk.

Somehow this week is when I stopped thinking of myself as “new” at QuillBot. Only 4 weeks in, that seems quite premature. I think that setting up rigorous note-taking and AI-assisted reflection processes have really accelerated my confidence-building, though.
