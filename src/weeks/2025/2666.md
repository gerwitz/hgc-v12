My consciousness remains dominated by leaving work. Though it begins to turn towards finding what’s next. I have to admit I was already worried enough about my positioning that I was perusing job postings, so I suppose it’s time to pursue some of them.

I’m trying to shift some focus to the Hexmap side project, too. But those thoughts and the work I manage go into a separate weeknote.

On Tuesday, I had a follow-up surgery on my nose. Far less intensive than the last one, but I’m still uncomfortable with the healing.

I’ve put way too much mental energy into trying to make the house we cannot afford realistic.
