Whew. This week we spent time with Shannon's parents in Chicago (hiding indoors in restaurants and the Art Institute because it was TOO COLD), at their home outside St. Louis, and then flying to NOLA and riding in the Freret parade.

The weather is perfect for it. Due to some logistical challenges we ended up with a less-than-amazing placement, but it was a great ride with amazing crowds. And we're proud to be a part of the first major plastic-bead-free Mardi Gras parade.

Today, though, Shannon is sick and we're staying in. This is fine; the weather took a bad turn and all of today's parades had to be rescheduled.
