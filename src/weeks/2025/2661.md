[The trip](/logs/travel/2025-nola) was great. This week included [the Orpheus ball](https://www.kreweoforpheus.com/orpheuscapade), both the Zulu and Rex parades (compressed to mostly floats), and the ridiculous pleasure of sleeping in first class pods on the way home.

Today is my 51st (well, 52nd?) birthday, of course, and Jeroen and Shannon held a proper 9-course dinner with several friends in the atelier. It was lovely, but today Shannon is very sick and so the day has been a quiet one at home despite the lovely false-spring weather.
