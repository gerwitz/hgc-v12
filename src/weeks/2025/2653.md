First week back at work and I feel really nicely reset but also back to into the flow.

We gave into temptation and viewed another house today, one that integrates a studio. The layout was near-perfect, and it’s in great shape. But the location gave us pause; nice and central, but there are no trees in sight and to go for a stroll would drop you in tourist-busy areas very quickly. So, it’s not “the one” but did spark a lot of thoughts.

Also caught up with friends freshly returned from their first trip back to the US. Nice reminder of how fortunate we are to have settled here.
