We _finally_ got a plan and quote for the rennovation on the new house this week, and it was entirely untenable. Despite so much discussion about our need to actually live there and hard budget constraints, we got a plan that would cost _hundreds of thousands_ too much and not be installing floors until a month after we move in. It was a hard but obvious decision to hit the brakes and revert to basic repairs, installing a kitchen, and a new bathroom.

It's painful that we lost so much time chasing an unrealistic dream and there is still much anxiety over arranging work and scheduling. But the fear of running out of savings is subsiding and I hope I'll be able to spend the holiday time with less existential dread.

The end of the year has aligned nicely as a transition time at work. I don't foresee any more departures, and new joiners start as soon as the holiday is over. And I'm looking forward to my first "strategic" summit, even if the location is not one I'd prefer.
