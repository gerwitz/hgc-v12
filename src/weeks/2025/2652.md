A second quiet week. Though we did get out and social on NYE, including the hair-raising experience of being on the streets of Amsterdam during the fireworks chaos.

Shannon decided to work out every day of the break, and I’ve followed suit. It feels great to use the fancy new indoor bike setup over-and-over-and-over. But, that won’t last now that it’s back to work.

The Rust project was a success not because it resulted in anything I can share, but because I now can just work on it without too much “how does this even work” context revival. I’ve even established a good working relationship with Copilot, which is helpful to a creepy “how did it know that” degree, yet more stupid than I expected.

I have many thoughts about Rust and modern software now that I indulged in being a software engineer again, but the biggest observation is about myself. It’s fun to _just build_ and not design first! Granted, coupled with a user-oriented mindset; I’m enjoying designing (in both the UX and architecture sense) as if this toy for myself might someday need to scale to thousands of users I don’t know.
