I started the last step towards Dutch citizenship on Monday, though it’s still going to be quite some time before that’s complete.

The remainder of the week was enjoyable: drinks with friends on Monday, HVOB concert on Friday, and finally some art time on Sunday.

I've finally glazed some of my porcelain Mardi Gras masks. With the forming of clay, I am able to get past my engineering perfectionism and lean into the handmade aspect of the work. But for some reason I find this so much more uncomfortable with the decorating. Maybe because I’m comparing myself to Shannon, which is ridiculous.
