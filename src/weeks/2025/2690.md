Good week outside work; drinks with friends on Monday, HVOB concert on Friday, and finally some art time on Sunday.

I've finally glazed some of my porcelain Mardi Gras masks. With the forming of clay, I am able to get past my engineering perfectionism and lean into the handmade aspect of the work. But for some reason I find this so much more uncomfortable with the decorating. Maybe because Iâ€™m comparing myself to Shannon, which is ridiculous.
