The only thing I'll remember about this week is that Mark's idea of how to build/manage teams and mine reached their conclusion: I'll be leaving Canonical shortly. (This weeknote will be delayed in publishing until logsitics and communication are ironed out.)

I have so many things to say but will keep them either private or save them for more productive general-purpose posts.
