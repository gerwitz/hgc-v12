I've crossed the 90 day mark at work and so my Friday reflection was deeper than most. My feelings are mixed: I had a rather rigid idea of my new-start priorities, and had to delay a few of them. But also some others have seen much faster progress than I hoped.

I'm mostly positive on the "did I make a good choice" angle, though! I enjoy most of my coworkers and feel optimsitic about the company and the design team. It's quite a bit more chaotic than I've experienced in the last decade, and the correlation between my busy-ness and my calendar is not very strong. This is both uncomfortable and fun.

Next week, we finish buying the new house! And already have had showings of the current one.
