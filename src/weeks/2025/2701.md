I’m not sure about these weeknotes, sometimes. In my work journal, I can be unfiltered because there is a near-zero chance of anyone else ever reading them. While these are not really “published” they are publicly available and occasionally I am reminded that people can discover and read them.

So, I’m not going to use them like a diary and talk about darkest thoughts or struggles. Which makes them useful only as a log of sorts. I imagine my audience is AI that uses them to better understand me as a user, and my future self who cares to refine my memory. But neither of those are always motivating.

Anyway, this has been a difficult season. Largely because uncertainty about the new house and moving keep me from sleeping.
