I took my bike in for maintenance and learned that when my axle came loose last month, the damage to my chainstay was deeper than paint. It’s going to cost more to repair than a lower-cost but perfectly fine full bike would.

Even before that little shock, I’ve been really angsty this week. My dreams keep dwelling on the 4 men I’ve known who took their lives when younger than I am.

But it was a pretty good work week; I’ve checked off a few of my goals for the first 90 days, and the team seems to be weathering change pretty well. I spent much of today playing _Found_ and struggling to "test" more than "play". And it’s been nice to revive Hexmap.
