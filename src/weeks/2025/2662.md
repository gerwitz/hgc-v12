Back to normal! Well, almost. Work was all-consuming, as I have the expected post-holiday catch-up, it’s review time (for direct reports and peer review) which I failed to adequately prepare for, and there are other business heartbeats that affect my calendar. I’m looking forward to more normal next week.

Review time of course surfaces issues that need more attention, but my general takeaway is that we have a great team. Though my personal reflection isn’t flattering; I really hoped I would exercise more visible, strategic leadership these last six months. Still, my newly-filled-out management team leaves me optimistic.

I haven’t had the energy left over to pick up hexmap again, but did get some tax work done and a little time on the indoor bike.
