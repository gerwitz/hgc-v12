Exciting week!

Our makelaar ran a bidding process for selling our house, and had a wild ride that started with many potential buyers dropping out, but still we ended up slightly above asking price. It's good-enough news, though I must admit I had hoped to get even more.

Meanwhile, we were supposed to finish buying the new one on Friday but things went sideways. The seller had not finished moving things out and there were a number of small problems. At the last minute, we simply postponed for another week. 😬

But it was Halloween so at least we moved on quickly to our (last?) house party.

Despite all this distraction, it was a fine work week and while there are no 🏅 in my weeknotes, I ended the week feeling more optimistic than I started.
