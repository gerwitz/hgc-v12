The big news in my life should be recovery from the bike crash. My body is doing well, and the wound on my face seems to have surprisingly left no scar at all. But my vision is still out of sorts and I am more comfortable on stairs with my eyes closed. Screen time is exhausting and my typing accuracy is terrible.

But, instead, the big news was hurricane Ian, which aimed straight for my mother and Lou. They characteristically decided to hunker down and we lost contact with them and watched the news on Tuesday and Wednesday of nearby areas being destroyed and concerns of hundreds of lives lost in their county.

Yet, they are inland and on high enough ground that they remained not only alive but safe and dry. I was able to reach them already on Thursday, even before NOAA arial photography was available to confirm their area lost trees but otherwise had only "typical" wind damage.

Still not ready to ride a bike, but made it to the ceramics studio twice this week.
