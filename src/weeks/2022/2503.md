We’re back home from the post-Mardi Gras visit to my mother. She and Lou seemed in great health and were in good spirits. It was a pleasant enough visit.

Still, it’s a bit tiring both because avoiding confrontation requires a good amount of filtering. We dared not bring up the invasion of Ukraine, for example. Anyway, Suburban Florida is not exactly a rejuvenating context and I was already out of extrovert juice before we even arrived.

I wish I had the stamina to return to New Orleans for the rest of the festivities. Stupid virus.
