Omicron recovery has not been swift for me. The worst of the symptoms cleared up, but headaches and fatigue linger.

On Wednesday at lunch, a self-test was still (weakly) positive. But in the evening I drank a mezcal mule, used some nasal spray, and tested negative at a clinic. So we were cleared to [fly to Mardi Gras](/logs/travel/2022-nola/) just in time.

It was fun but a struggle. It helped a lot to feed off the positive energy from Shannon and our friends Ric, Kristin, Jeroen, and Dylan. I think a major part of my love of Mardi Gras is watching Captain Bobby and the core krewe team make the Freret parade happen. I am convinced it deserves a Harvard case study in how to build a resiliant organization sustained by passion.
