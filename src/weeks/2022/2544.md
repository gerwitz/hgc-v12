The highlight of this week was IKEA.

Seriously, we've not gone to IKEA since we moved to a house that made it convenient, and our trip was to order the kitchen for the new atelier. It still took too long and was busy with poorly-behaved members of the public, but served as a nice milestone nonetheless.

For work, our quarterly planning goes well and I feel pretty good about the latest iteration of team structure. Too soon to declare any success, though, and I expect our org context will change so much in Q1 it will be difficult to judge.

My [shoulder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive_capsulitis_of_the_shoulder) is quite painful, but I can't get an ultrasound appointment until January so there's nothing to do but keep taking ibuprofen like candy.
