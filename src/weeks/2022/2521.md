Shannon’s parents are in town. The good news is I enjoy their company. They are good people, and smart, and we have enough charmed contexts to carry conversations across multiple meals.

The bad news is that they aren’t very city-familiar, so the vibrancy of Amsterdam is a bit overwhelming for them and worrying about them enjoying themself is a bit overwhelming for us. All the more reason they need to move closer and adjust!

I left work early on Wednesday to visit Dordrecht with them (it’s charming, if unremarkable). On Saturday we visited Den Haag, and otherwise have enjoyed Amsterdam.

Friday morning I gave a small presentation about our Philips DLS program to Shannon’s team. This reminded me I need to present more often to help focus my perspective. Also, Philips presents a good opportunity to add a compelling story to my history, and I need to capitalize.
