Shannon had a second lockdown birthday. We got fancy tea from the Waldorf Astoria, which was good but not quite as nice as previous times. I tried to plan an “illegal” party but covid made that directly impossible. She enjoys celebrating birthdays, we really will need to make up for this over summer.

My mind at work is very high-level; I’ve applied for one of several leadership positioned being opened as part of the reorganization, and am struggling with some FUD over some late changes in direction. (I’m not directly affected but need to make sure we reposition effectively and avoid unnecessary drama.)

I just noticed that week 2500 is almost here. This feels like a good time for a mid-life crisis.
