The week started with taking Shannon's parents to their last two dinners in town. It was nice to use guests as an excuse to discover new places, and to finally get some insight into their hopes for retiring to Europe.

It ended with some "coaching" at work that put me in a sour mood; one must be careful who one holds up as an example of desirable behavior. It led me to some self-reflection on how much I miss working with other nerds.
