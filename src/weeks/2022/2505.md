My birthday passed without serious notice, which is probably for the best. Passing week 2500 and Covid have already put me in a midlife malaise.

I had several interviews this week for a different role at work. It would be exciting not only because it is a higher pay grade, but also “in the room” for leadership during a time of organizational change. I probably want it more than I admit to myself, but I’m one of three viable candidates and the others would better improve the diversity of the leadership team (at least demographically). So I hesitate to imagine that future.
