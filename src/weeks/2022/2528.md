This was one of those weeks at work where I finally cleared some time in my schedule to focus, but then ended up losing most of it to communicating. Still, some progress was made.

I also submitted applications to two different roles within the company. One is inside Design and I don't feel optimistic about my chances (though I do think I could enjoy it and be effective). I was asked to apply, I think for the experience rather than a lack of alternative candidates. The other I was recruited for and is outside Design; that one would be a career choice to more business leadership and, perhaps, a return to "tech". That opportunity has really gotten me thinking.
