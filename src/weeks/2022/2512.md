This Koningsdag week was introvert-exhausting. Walking through the street parties Tuesday night bled into a house party Wednesday morning and eventually to exploring the Kingâ€™s Day until evening. Thursday night we went to the ceramics studio, Friday we went out for sushi with Shannonâ€™s coworkers. We were out all Saturday walking all over the city and ended up at cocktail bars after midnight, then back to the ceramic studio today (Sunday).

I need some alone time. ðŸ˜†
