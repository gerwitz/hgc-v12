First week back to the office was as expected. The usual suspects created urgency out of thin air, so I returned to "emergency" requests to prepare reports and presentations. Thankfully all of it was easily addressed.

We got a new easel for Shannon to use in the home studio. I didn't realize it until it was here, but this really feels like a big milestone in *really* living in Amsterdam.
