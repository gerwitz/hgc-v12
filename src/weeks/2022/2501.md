The COVID-19 test I took on [Sunday](/weeks/2500/) came back positive overnight. Which makes sense, as my symptoms worsened quickly. I took two days off work and slowed down the rest of the week, with very poor timing. But it’s not like I’m a surgeon or firefighter, the world is not appreciably worse off for my absence.

This has to be Omicron, and is “mild” in that I haven’t had the shortness of breath or loss of smell from my [counterfeit covid](/weeks/2493/) of December. But it’s way more intense than a flu. If I follow the usual arc, though, I have contracted this just in time to recover for Mardi Gras.
