I felt pretty on top of things at work this week, finding myself ready to respond to requests for detail. There are some people management challenges, and the role that I'd hoped for turning into "we don't really know what we're looking for" drama spent a lot of my goodwill. So even these good weeks feel pretty flat.

Joined Shannon for the ceramics studio again on Tuesday and Saturday. I have no skill or talent, yet find it fairly enjoyable anyway. I think a major contributor to that is a sense that no one is judging me. It's child-like playtime.

For Easter Sunday, we had (long ago, not realizing it was Easter!) high tea at the Waldorf. It was nice if not amazing; having such fancy experiences a short walk from home is a joy that never gets old.
