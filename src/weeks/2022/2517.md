This was a rather ordinary week, and a ride to Marken on Saturday and a long Sunday ceramics session this weekend left me feeling refreshed.

I engaged in some professional networking this week. Not towards finding a new job in the near future, rather I should call it career hygiene. It was quite refreshing, remembering how vast the world is and how many opportunities exist even in little Amsterdam. Somewhat paradoxically, it renewed my energy even for planning to stay the course.
