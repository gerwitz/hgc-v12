Still no word on the role I interviewed for at work. There is one external opportunity that has my eye, but not seriously enough to shrug this off.

The stress is relieved by the weather, though. Got out on the road on both Thursday and Sunday, which does wonders for my mood. I've been listening to podcasts to keep my effort more aerobic, which also gives me things to think about besides my personal life.
