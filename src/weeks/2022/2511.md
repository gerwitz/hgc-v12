I love four day workweeks with lightly-scheduled Fridays to focus on work when I still feel momentum. Of course, my American work ethic makes me feel like I'm not working hard enough.

We spent Monday on the roof terrace, with friends joining. Quite pleasant.

Today (Sunday) I finally rode outside for the first time in a month. We spent more time in the ceramics studio on Tuesday and Saturday. Both of these activities are calming and somehow feel like _the right thing to be doing_. Somehow they also feel empty, like the lockdown lingers in my soul.
