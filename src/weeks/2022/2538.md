Shannon's COVID experience was both short and low-intensity. We both isolated but she only spent a couple of days really sick, never had problems with her breath, and was testing negative by Friday. I took a few tests and was never positive.

Not much worth logging from work, but the week felt productive. Quite a few plans finally getting underway.

Highlight of the week was Maria Abramović's [No Intermission](https://mai.art/projects/nointermission) on Saturday at the Carré.
