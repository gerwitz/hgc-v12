Lou's diagnosis set this week off to a bad start.

Then I saw a specialist who confirmed my self-diagnosis of [my vision problems](/2022/09/20/mortal.html) (likely caused by a concussion) but for now I can only hope my brain re-adjusts and we'll do more extensive tests again in two months. It was comforting to have my understanding confirmed by an expert, yet unsettling to serve as a case study for her students.

It's really exhausting to visually focus for long, which makes screen use difficult. I feel supported by coworkers but also self-conscious about my fragility.
