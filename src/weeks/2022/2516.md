Most of this week was spent [in Florence](/logs/travel/2022-florence/). Too hot and full of American tourists, but it was a joy to meet up with friends and simply get away.

Before that, though, there was a dramatic work meeting. I later got a lot of positive feedback from my team for keeping cool, focusing on outcomes, and projecting confidence. Meanwhile, I also saw how our operational structure means I could go on holiday and really just “let go”.

I don’t want to think I need compliments. Recently, though, I’ve been so focused on my weaknesses as a corporate influencer. I think it was really healthy to take a break from my imposter syndrome.

Shannon’s job is high-stress lately, and her grace at dealing with it is amazing.
