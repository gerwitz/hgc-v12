Interviewed for a different position in Philips today. Too soon to be making plans but I have to admit getting very interested in how it would be.

Also finally got to Eindhoven for the first time in weeks. It's nice to connect in person with that team, and reminds me how much I need our travel restrictions to lift so I might visit the Bangalore crew.

I arranged a new housekeeper this week. That is a big reminder of how privileged we are.

Today (Sunday) I got stung by a bee right in my lower lip while riding. After a few minutes of wondering if I was going to live, I just have a large and numb lip that makes me feel like a cartoon character.
