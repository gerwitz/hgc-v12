This week saw new sofa parts for a different living room layout, a VvE meeting, some interesting networking, and some ceramics studio time. But the memorable part is definitely [Welcome to the Future](http://welcometothefuture.nl/), my first proper Dutch music festival. It was great, I will definitely being doing this again and again.

I tried MDMA for the first time; but the friends supplying were very conservative and under-dosed me. I felt slightly more thirsty and maintained a slight "buzz" despite not drinking any more alcohol, but that was all. Perhaps I don't have enough serotonin around to be boosted. All for the best; I can't be certain it was pure nor predict how I would react.
