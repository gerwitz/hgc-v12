It’s been a quiet week. I only half-worked to catch up on my inbox, and Shannon took a week of holiday to recover from Mardi Gras (and Florida) with studio time.

There are effectively no more pandemic restrictions on public life, now. It’s quite refreshing and we’ve enjoyed a return to normal life trying new places to dine. Importantly, we’ve found passable deep-dish pizza and genuine NY-style bagels here in Amsterdam.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is quite anxiety-producing, considering I don’t have any close friends directly affected.

I think I feel slightly less Covid-tired? It’s hard to quantify, especially with long-distance travel and time off work.
