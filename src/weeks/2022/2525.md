I started the week with [a small group ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/7527674435) I've been considering since moving to the east side of town. We visited the garage we'd like to put a studio in and put in an offer to buy it, which could be the beginning of a big, long-term project. I put a lot of my "stacked" ceramics pieces in queue to glaze for the first time.

The real news, though, is the new bike.
