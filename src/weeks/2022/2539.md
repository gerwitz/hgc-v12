Work is draining despite not really demanding that much from me. It's hard to explain how much the emotional side of management can be decoupled from the "workload" so a week with less calendar demand or deadline stress than usual is nonetheless exhausting. I am genuinely optimistic about new leadership and the company as a whole, but really looking forward to getting past this vibe dip.

Also with the studio. The future is bright, but on the immediate horizon is just a lot of project management and expenses. And home! After a year of planning, we finally have a contractor installing new shelving and fixing up other things that involve the concrete walls. It will be a relief, but right now is just more chaos.

But we spent some time at the ceramics studio and I should really stop complaining about life.
