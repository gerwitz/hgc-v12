It was a very normal pre-covid week. Two days commuting to Eindhoven. Dinner with colleagues because my new boss is in town. A late night at Little White Bird. A show at Melkweg with Dylan, then another night at the Bird. Biscuit pilgrimage. Shopping. Ceramics studio. Polder riding. A concert of the neighbor’s orchestra.

But I’m still not used to this much normal.
