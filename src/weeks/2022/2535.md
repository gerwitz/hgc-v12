Friends from Missouri and England in town means we've been busy as tour guides (including taking Friday off work). The sharing is fun, and I'm always curious to see what about Amsterdam life stands out to visitors.

There has been a lot of food, karaoke, and some authentic the-pot-is-strong-here drama. I got myself back on the bike to ride the basic Abcoude loop with Ryan and Shannon. The weather was great and the pace reasonable so it made for a perfect back-in-the-saddle return.

Shannon and I also went to see a potential studio space and liked it more than I expected. And Shannon got fitted for her fancy new bike. Busy, busy, but work was calm.
