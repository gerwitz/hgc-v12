The anniversary staycation was good; Shannon called it "an artist residency in our house". We did more fine dining than usual, but in many ways it was like a prolonged version of a typical weekend. The heatwave prevented as much activity as we'd hoped but we walked a lot in the mornings, spent time at the ceramics studio, rode our sport bikes, refreshed the roof garden and added irrigation, painted and played with code. My keystone project was testing a complete STL-to-cermaics workflow, which I think is interesting enough I ought to write it up.

Most importantly, I _really_ unplugged and did not think much about work. Shannon stayed a bit more mentally connected, but even when traveling for holiday I've never seen her spend so little time "at work".
