I’m still struggling to find energy for work, but have some new determination to take control over my own destiny. We had a small workshop with one of my teams on Friday that was nice.

I got to ride out on the polders on Monday and Friday, summer is back! On Thursday I got to enjoy a neighbor’s pass to watch the [Bevrijdingsdag concert](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/bevrijdingsdag-als-vanouds-afgesloten-met-concert-op-amstel-festivals-succesvol-verlopen~aab2d3cb/) that brought the king and queen to our neighborhood. The main event of the week, though, was definitely the dinner/movie party with Jeroen serving us a 6 course menu and cocktail pairings. House parties are back!
