Work has remained quiet, as so many colleagues are still on holiday. I'm already disappointed at how little catch-up I've been able to complete during the slowdown.

Today, our Christmas tree was retrieved, to be returned to their place in a tree farm somewhere to enjoy the rest of the year outdoors. I'm glad to see it go and mark the march of the season, sad to have spent Christmas in the omicron lockdown, and really missing hikes through pine forests.
