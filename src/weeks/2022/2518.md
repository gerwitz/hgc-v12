Shannon's stressful work situation reached its crescendo this week. Mine was a productive but not noteworthy week mostly spent coordinating plans and feeling trapped between operations and strategy.

On Friday I got in a ride and then went out for drinks. Saturday was a house party, with a bit too much to drink. Sunday was a delightful [club event on a boat](https://ra.co/events/1513511) and then Bar 27. Drank way too much. Tonight (Monday) we will go to a candelight string quartet performance and I will avoid drinking too much.
