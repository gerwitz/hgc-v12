A fairly quiet week to recover from Pride. But by Friday we were in a Karaoke box with a giant crew. Saturday felt like a weird episode from an overly-dramtic TV series, learning many new things about friends over brunch and cocktails and a birthday party. Too many affirmations of gender stereotypes.

The heat has been too much, through not nearly as bad as most of Europe. Today (Sunday) we had a morning walk and installed some a watering system on the roof terrace but otherwise were couch potatoes.

Work was calm, everyone's on holiday and I'm catching up on a lot of administrative things. I met a recruiter in person for the first time since the pandemic (but only casually networking).
