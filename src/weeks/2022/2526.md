We put in a bid for the garage but lost to an investment company. It's a bit heartbreaking, but at least the uncertainty is over and we can continue hunting.

Pride was pretty great, from the street parties on Friday to a brunch at our place followed by walking the parade route on Saturday. The crowds were too thick to see the boats, and seemed less "dancy" than I remember. Too many straight people out to party, not enough DJs. But, still, it felt great to see Amsterdam back at it.

The ceramics studio remains an introvert sanctuary, though I'm not really sure which direction I want to take.
