Notable work week: quarterly planning ([PIPE](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/)) wrapped up on Tuesday, which is a relief. We celebrated our [big award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gerwitz_philipsexperiencedesign-activity-6945657738760732672-SXb4) with a party on Thursday. A colleague threw a boat party for her farewell on Friday, and drinks with a small group followed. I felt more like I was a part of the organization than I usually do.

Otherwise, long walks and ceramics and bike rides and the usual weekend things. Amsterdam is being its lovely summer self, but stress levels at home temper the enjoyment of it.
