I had a little more breathing room than usual in my work schedule this week, which has helped me feel like I actually work by thinking instead of simply talking to people.

Friday ended with cocktail crawling until 2:00, which was a nice "Amsterdam is back" moment. Saturday included dinner with a new colleague, and Sunday I joined Shannon at the ceramics studio and started learning to mess around with clay. All of this was a pretty good reset.
