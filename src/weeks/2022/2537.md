Thursday was our first ADE event, with last-minute tickets (thanks to Dylan) for Worakls. It was a great show, with a much better crowd than the last time we were at NDSM Loods.

It's also maybe where Shannon got COVID. I got my vaccine booster on Friday, she tested positive on Saturday. We had to cancel our plans for the Mystic Garden/Dockyard festival. and begin isolating.

Work is in a weird liminal space of planning for the future amidst uncertainty. My calendar was less packed than usual, but I feel even more overwhelmed with interactions.
