Thursday was our first ADE event, with last-minute tickets (thanks to Dylan) for Worakls. It was a great show, with a much better crowd than the last time we were at NDSM Loods.

It's also maybe where Shannon got COVID. I got my vaccine booster on Friday, she tested positive on Saturday. We had to cancel our plans for the Mystic Garden/Dockyard festival. and begin isolating.

We also learned on Friday that our offer was accepted on the studio. It's exciting and stressful that our short time being concerned with only one property is over.

Work is in a weird liminal space of planning for the future amidst uncertainty. My calendar was less packed than usual, but I feel even more overwhelmed with interactions.
