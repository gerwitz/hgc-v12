Big work week as our DesignOps department, which we've moved my program into, went through quarterly planning. It is not without drama, but mostly I am impressed and proud of the teams.

I was proud to vote in the local election (for [BIJ1](https://amsterdam.bij1.org/)). Reminds me to pursue the upgrade from residency to citizenship, if only for the right to vote in the national elections.

I'm embarassed to note that I made no effort to support [TDAD](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=transit%20driver%20appreciation%20day) this year. My excuses are lingering covid fatigue and a very busy workweek, but I will re-engage next year.
