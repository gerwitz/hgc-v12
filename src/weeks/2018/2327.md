I'm feeling impotent. Just one small cog in a large machine, and too many levels removed from decision making. This is not what I signed up for when I was initially recruited.

Still, I like my colleagues and believe in the company's goals, so this doesn't mean giving up. I just have to figure out what "try harder" looks like.
