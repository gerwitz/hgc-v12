We spent a three-day weekend in Cologne (Köln) with a group of friends to visit the Christmas markets. It was bitter cold but cozy nonetheless.

Any time I start to get annoyed that Amsterdam lets cars be a little dominant, or struggles to accommodate surges of tourists, or doesn't have the best vegetarian options…I only need to visit any other city and be reminded why this is home.
