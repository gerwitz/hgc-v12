First day at work was Wednesday. Spent most of it figuring out that my macOS login was unrelated to my network login, then tracking down how to enable a network login. Along the way, I encountered many IT points of contact, and the "Apple" support was far and away the best.

I'm quite on my own to figure out the org, even who is on my own team.

A Friday visit to Google was fun. It's interesting to see their consulting arm feels like any other.
