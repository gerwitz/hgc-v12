Over the first three days of the week I gradually shared the news that I'm leaving; from all directions they are doing a fine job making me feel appreciated. I have to admit I'm feeling a bit guilty about leaving during the org turmoil.

We moved into the atelier on Friday! It's not 100% finished but we'll be _using_ it rather than _building_ it quite soon.
