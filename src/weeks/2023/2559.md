We received and assembled tables in the atelier, and did some cleaning. There is still a lot of work to do but this really made it feel real and we're getting excited to _use_ it.

We also went to a members-only viewing of the [Vemeer show](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/12/vermeer-rijksmuseum-amsterdam-review-one-of-the-most-thrilling-exhibitions-ever-conceived) which was a delight. The exhibition is extremely well presented and the crowd was very light.

On Friday, a lot of data but not much information was shared regarding the reorganization Philips relevant to my team. This has led to a lot of drama and confusion, but nothing that can't be overcome or overshadowed by other news soon.
