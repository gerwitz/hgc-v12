So many 10-meeting days, even without the simultaneous multitasking problem I complained about last week, the context switching made work more tiring than it needs to be this week. Hopefully as I have more operational processes in place, I’ll find a rhythm!

On Saturday, we hosted [The First Supper](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyJhiswormW/) in the atelier with some friends enjoying Jeroen’s cooking, on tableware Shannon created, with cocktails from her and Peter. There were certainly some learnings on how to run such a production more smoothly in the studio, but the experience was pleasantly between houseparty and fine dining. Another successful use of the space, another introvert-exhausting Saturday.
