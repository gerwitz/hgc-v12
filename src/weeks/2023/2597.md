I started this week stressed out about getting my metaphorical work desktop cleared before holiday, but by midweek was already feeling quite comfortable. Already, the effect of a shared holiday across the (most of) the company is evident, as everyone is similarly motivated to wrap up. So, now I feel “checked out” to a degree I really did not think possible.

On Saturday, Shannon held a “market” at the atelier which included two other artists. It was a good party and some art was sold; I sold [two bunnies and a candle holder](/projects/ceramics), the latter to a stranger. I guess that makes me a professional artist, now. 😆
