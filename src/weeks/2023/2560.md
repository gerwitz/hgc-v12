I'll have to commit this retroactively because I've resigned from Philips and this isn't public news, yet. I received the offer from Canonical on Wednesday, resigned on Thursday, and have told only one colleague (because I wanted their permission to suggest them as my backfill). It's exciting, of course, but doesn't quite feel real yet.

Outside work, the highlight of the week was a private dinner Jeroen made for us.
