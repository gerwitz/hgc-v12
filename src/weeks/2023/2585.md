Berlin was good. Shannon and I saw She Wants Revenge on Monday and had a great dinner and incredible drinks at Cookies Cream on Tuesday.

Then I spent 3 days with my team where we met in person to sustain social connections, welcome newcomers, and kick-off some horizontal initiatives. I felt under-prepared and I learned a lot about how this sort of event could be better, but in the end it went well and valuable enough to merit the cost.
