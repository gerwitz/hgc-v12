My last week at Philips was more emotional than I expected, with members of my teams and others embarrassing me with generous send-off speeches in Eindhoven and online. But cloudy Friday was typically empty in the Amsterdam office, which made turning in my laptop and badge feel dramatically alone.

Afterwards, I somehow wove between thunderstorms and finally got a ride in outside. Light traffic, cloudy skies, just music and tarmac.

Now I'm off to Prague for 2 weeks to get up to speed with Canonical. It would have been great to take some time between jobs, but that's not how the timing of opportunity worked out. When I met a colleague for dinner here on Thursday, he
shared how much prep he did before starting. So now, besides the usual imposter syndrome, I'm haunted by the feeling that I've not done my homework.
