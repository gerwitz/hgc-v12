Although I'm a little past my first 90 days, the way I started work during a gathering makes this feel like the end of my first 3 months. Generally, I'm in a good place and feel like I know what's important, where my attention is best spent, and have the trust of stakeholders I need. But I also still feel overwhelmed with the overall scope and haven't managed to delegate sufficiently. I'm getting there.

Our highlight of the week was definitel yhosting bunch on Saturday for gathering prior to the Pride parade.
