I ended my work week on Wednesday sharing bad news, it made unplugging emotionally difficult.

The weather in New Orleans was lovely today (Sunday). Unfortunately, we rode yesterday and it was terrible. Cold wind and rain defined our ride; the crowds were light but dedicated so interactions were rich. Same as every year, it's all a bit of a blur after hours spent in "social brain" mode.
