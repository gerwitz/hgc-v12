I kept my head more in the forest than the trees at work this week, which feels good. Not because I don’t enjoy diving into to details, but because I worry about giving enough attention to the strategic demands of my job.

The real news of the week is the atelier kiln. We finally got the new electricity meter installed on Monday, Jeroen helped us correct some poor wiring organization on Tuesday, and we fired the kiln on Wednesday. The controller and oven all worked great, and all the work made it through! But the air quality in the atelier reached dangerous levels of VOCs and especially high PM2.5 levels. We have to hold that directly running ventilation to the kiln and having burnt off the first-use dust will improve this; otherwise we will have to figure out how to fire when we aren’t present.
