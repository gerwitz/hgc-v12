Shannon and I spoke with a lawyer about some long-term plans and it reminded me just how disappointed I am by most service providers (lawyers, accountants, contractors). I don't know how much it is a "Dutch thing" that so many of them expect us to tell them exactly what we need them to do and fail to act as advisors in any capacity, or how much this would also be true in the US and we have simply needed such people more often here.

It is increasingly clear at work that my energy is best spent building up the team. The downside of rigorous screening for smart and motivated people is that it takes forever to get someone hired.
