Monday was another holiday, and next Monday, too. My work schedule is already getting tight, without much room to focus. But 7 hours this week were interviews, including a Director candidate who came to Amsterdam to meet me, and the rest of my time also matched my chosen priorities. On Friday I gave my first presentation about those priorities and it was well received, so I'm feeling pretty good about initial orientation.

Had a good weekend with a Saturday ride up to Marken and a proper Sunday spent with clay in the atelier.
