Three people onboarded into or adjacent to my team this week into roles that are very important to my objectives. It's been tiring to prep for them but I am confident we will see new kinds of progress quickly.

Shannon was on a panel for [Ladies that UX](https://ladiesthatux.com) which highlighted how accomplished she's been, professionally. Meanwhile, she's been continuing to make art and has committed to learning some new tools so she can finally create some interactive digital work that's long been in her head. Her capacity for learning and drive to create are inspiring as always, and I remain flattered she would choose to spend life with me.
