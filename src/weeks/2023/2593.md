My workweek started with 2024 headcount budgeting, which put me into an appropriately strategic stance that was quickly interrupted by operational concerns. I need to improve my delegation, for sure.

Mostly, though, I was under the weather. I even took Thursday off to just rest and take serial naps. Barely recovered enough to enjoy brunch with friends now that Ryan is in town.
