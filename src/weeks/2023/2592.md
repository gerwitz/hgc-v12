The second sprint week was less pressure but still very busy. The week ended with a number of 1:1 catch-ups with my team which were quite positive and a great way to wrap up. Even better, I was able to change my flight home to be an earlier direct, so I had dinner at home instead of in a layover airport.

Besides a visit to the atelier, the weekend has been spent at home with Shannon and the cats and I couldn't be happier about that.
