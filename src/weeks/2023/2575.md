The flood cleanup continues, as does my frustration with the atelier VvE's administration firm. But on Thursday we got some more IKEA shelving delivered and Shannon built it, things really are looking polished. We should have attended a VvE meeting on Thursday, but I was too overwhelmed to deal with a complex, boring meeting in Dutch.

It was a very "normal" work week, which feels weird to say already. Only 20% of my time currently feels like it's at the strategy level I should be, but we have a lot of staffing to do before that will change.
