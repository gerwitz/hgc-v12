This was a good workweek, I feel like I have clarity on operational needs and my strategic coals, even if the actual shift from "strutting the team to get things done" to "keeping them on course" is still distant over the horizon of adequate staffing.

The atelier is still drying, and our ventilation fan is stuck in full-speed or off. So it ran the whole time we were there on Tuesday and Thursday. But the end of Thursday, I was exhausted and practically had a panic attack that preventing us from attending the VvE meeting. The weekend, though, has been super calm while our contractor got some finishing touches done there.
