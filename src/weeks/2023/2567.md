Only a 3-day workweek, thanks to delayed holidays. I'm still in my first month but feel quite on board. I've begun meeting every team member 1:1 and after about a third of them I already see some really actionable patterns.

Shannon is really suffering from the flu I brought back from Prague; far worse than I did. But the timing is pretty great since it's Tears of The Kingdom month.

A friend is in town planning a move from St. Louis, but between work overload and disease, we're really unsocial. At least they aren't just stopping by, there will be plenty of opportunity to catch up.
