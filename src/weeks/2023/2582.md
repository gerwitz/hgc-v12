Re-entry to work felt different than in other jobs. Both easier in the “nothing new caught on fire” sense, but still frantic because I see the end of month approach and have not achieved several goals I had for it.

Friday night was I met Jeroen for drinks until Shannon joined, and the Tailor crew gave us way too many free tastes. Fun in the moment, regret later, very authentic. Sunday started with a brunch to welcome our Missouri friends to Amsterdam, and then was super productive making the atelier nicer.
