Back to normal at work, though it still felt a bit frantic as I took Friday off so had to scramble to wrap up the week a day early. I’ll have to hit the ground running full speed on Monday morning!

The three day weekend was delightful, with only one social engagement. We spent it on hobby pursuits making ceramics and writing code. I’ve added maps to the [trip pages](/logs/travel/), which was a bigger challenge than I expected. After I mature it a little I should write it up like a proper open source participant.
