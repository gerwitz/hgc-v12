My colleague Mike really started "taking over" from me this week. Most of my time is already going to transition via talking or sifting through documents.

On Thursday, Shannon and I both worked from the atelier and received a big delivery of clay and a pottery wheel. It's the milestone a we've been anticipating for months.

Friday, I celebrated a bit too hard and spent the weekend regretting it. I blame our bartending friends for being too generous.
