For my third week on the job, two members of the design team resigned. Though they both cite longstanding issues and such decisions are not made abruptly, it's hard not to take this personally. It will be a setback to workforce rebuilding and, wrose, establishing culture; but of course change is opportunity and all that.

Otherwise, work goes well. I'm gradually discovering which rituals are worth my attention and how to discern horizontal priorities.

New Zelda dropped on Friday. Shannon is all-in, on Saturday I gave in and bought the download. Solid way to clear the mind from work, which otherwise consumes my consciousness (in a good way).
