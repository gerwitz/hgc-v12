Shannon ran our first glaze fire on Tuesday, which reaches a higher temperature than the bisque fire last week. This time, we had a ventilation pipe positioned directly over the kilnâ€™s vent and it seemed to be working until the higher-than-last-time temp was reached. Then, again, we saw a spike in pollution and especially VOC fumes. It was disheartening.

But then on Friday, another firing and the air quality remained solid. We are optimistic that the kiln needed to outgas the first time it reached high temps, but on repeat usage our meticulous ventilation setup will keep everything safe.

Now we are off to Berlin for my cross-team off-site, which I feel woefully unprepared for.
