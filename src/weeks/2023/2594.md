Very stressful workweek, largely due to personnel concerns. Also a bunch of interviews, though, which feels like progress even when I reject candidates. I took Friday off and remembered how much I enjoy 3-day weekends.

The Little White Bird was open on Saturday and led to much socializing, and I celebrated a Thanksgiving potluck with Shannon’s crew from VanMoof in the atelier. Never mind that we’re the only Americans.
