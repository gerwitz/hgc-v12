I’m writing this a day late, on Christmas Monday, because we spent Friday through Sunday [hiking through Doi Inthanon](/logs/travel/2023-thailand).  The trip so far has gone smoothly and the weather for the trek was perfect. Nothing feels like Christmas but it’s a great way to spend the holiday and my mind has been free of regular concerns.
