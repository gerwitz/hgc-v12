I spent too much of this week feeling reactive, after the upcoming sprints I'll need to think about what I can do to prevent more escalations.

I've managed to repair some ceramics work that had been damaged at the old public studio, and finally see all the bunnies I've built as a collection.

Our "home bar" is losing their manager, so we visited for a farewell on Saturday. This was ill-advised, because today on Sunday I had to wake up early to fly to Riga for the sprints. The location seems nice; I have a great room and the old city center is quite charming.
