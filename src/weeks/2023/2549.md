The cold (probably RSV) that Shannon fought for the last week came for me on Saturday. And hard, now (Monday) my throat is practically swollen shut, talking or swallowing is immensely painful. At least I don't have the cough.

With this, my shoulder still "frozen", and my eyes still wonky, I really feel like I've come apart.
