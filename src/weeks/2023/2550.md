That respiratory infection really got me. My throat was unusable through Monday. I had a false recovery and went to the office on Tuesday, but my sinuses took over from there. It is still lingering; I've lost two weekends to this. I barely made it through an eye-measuring exam on Wednesday.

Thanks to pseudoephedrine we were able to enjoy a dinner cruise through the light festival on Saturday, though.
