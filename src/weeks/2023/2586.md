My work agenda was packed but included some monthly lean-back meetings I could work during. But I’m re-learning how much “multitasking” is a myth. It’s fine to listen along and also do some simple things, but meaningfully reading or writing while also listening and watching is, obviously, a mistake. Yet I try, and wonder why I’m so drained of energy at the end of the day.

The highlight of the week was certainly the opening party for [Atelier Awful](https://awful.amsterdam/), which was something between a housewarming party and art opening. We hadn’t yet shown the studio to hardly anyone, most had never seen Shannon’s art, and we invited from a diverse set of social circles. So the 40ish people who came by made for a vibrant crowd and left us introvert-exhausted.
