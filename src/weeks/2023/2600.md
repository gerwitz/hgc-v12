I received confirmation from the government that I can become a citizen. Only must wait a bit for a ceremony, but if I want to retain US citizenship there is at least a year of twists and turns ahead.

Looking back at 2023, it feels like a remarkably long year despite [limited life events](/logs/events/). But between starting my job and Shannon’s ending, the pace of change has smeared the perception of time. So, here we are, 20 months after 2023 began.

I’m very happy to note that the priority notes I left myself at the end of last year hold up after the time-away reflection.
