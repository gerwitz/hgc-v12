Whew. The first week of sprint was nonstop, my only real downtime was eating dinner alone on Wednesday. It was good to present Design to our new hires and to get back into the groove of being in front of crowds during the Ubuntu Summit. And Summit turned out to be more interesting than I'd hoped, with a lot of design-related activity and new connections.

But, exhausting. So I'm writing this on Monday morning before getting back onto the sprint train for another week.
