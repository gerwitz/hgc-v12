I'm finally finding clarity of purpose at work. This comes with some disappointment, because I've come to accept the most productive scope is different than where my passion lies. It is not small or marginal, though, so I shall not complain.

Personally I am struggling mightily to find energy. I would be tempted to diagnose myself as depressed, but that implies a lack of control, or even blindness to the source. Unfortunately it is probably more accurate to say I understand the drains on my motivation, but lack the courage and discipline to address them.
