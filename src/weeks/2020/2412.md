Another short week, more time for Animal Crossing!

I can’t stop thinking about how badly “my people” in tech have fucked up their role in society. Google was supposed to bring the world’s knowledge to our fingertips, but Wikipedia did that while they built up platforms for click-baiting conspiracy wingnuts. Facebook was supposed to make the world more peaceful by connecting us with each other, but they’ve only supported our bubbles and helped radicals find each other. It’s fine that this happens for furries, good that it supports solarpunks, but the fascists are a problem.

But like mediocre college students, they cling to their childhood principles as if the age of an idea correlates to truth.
