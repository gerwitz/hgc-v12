My mother may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via her doctor, who fell ill the day after seeing her. She’s distancing from Lou and we’re all just waiting to see. The high latency caused by our different communication styles means I’ll have to start calling to find out.

We’re finally under contract on the new house. Now to sell the current one! We have some repairs to do before it will show well, and our handyman has flaked out, so there’s a little stress there. Thankfully, the “bridge loan” approach used here in the Netherlands and the healthy market in Amsterdam means we needn’t hurry.
