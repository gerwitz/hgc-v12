My aunt Helen passed away; I guess technically at the end of last week. I’m reviving childhood memories of her by eating St. Louis-style Italian food and remembering her hospitality during the infamous Colorado Springs repossession operation.

The one-on-one introductions to our program team seems to be paying off; I see formerly-quiet team members speaking up more in my presence and some pro-actively bringing things to my attention. Hopefully it helped make me disarming when I ran a tangential meeting many of them attended and brought [goats](https://www.cronkshawfoldfarm.co.uk/goatsonzoom) into the video call.

It’s palindrome week, and almost solstice. How auspicious!

The next two weeks should be very quiet, I need to motivate myself to write or build something rather than fritter the time away playing [Outlanders](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outlanders/id1463407936).
