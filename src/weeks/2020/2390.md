Christmas at home was nice, but maybe too low-key. ("Home" in the city sense, we celebrated with nice meals and a canal cruise dinner with Natalia.) Shannon and I resolved to holly it up a bit in 2020.

I reduced my work inbox to a very small list. It's a weird feeling, since I haven't properly wrapped up at a job this way since 2007.
