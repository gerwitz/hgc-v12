A 5-day workweek, bookended by 2-day weekends. How ordinary!

But not. I’m becoming more aware of my own pandemic anxiety. Work is not going poorly but I’m constantly disappointed I haven’t accomplished more. I feel trapped at home and frustrated at careless people when I’m outside. We’re staying up late tonight to Zoom into a virtual wedding ceremony 7 times zones away.

We have started entertaining other houses and even went to view one. This is partly motivated by genuine annoyance with some neighbors, but mostly is seeking inspiration. Considering possible futures that are different than continuing today feels a bit like travel. I think it’s important to keep the imagination engaged like this.
