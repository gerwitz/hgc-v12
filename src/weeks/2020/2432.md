Only a week in the new house and we are quite settled in. There are countless little jobs remaining and the laundry still isnt set up, but it feels quite natural to wake up here. If anything, it's taking some getting used to the feeling of luxury, as if we're staying in a nice hotel.

I reached a threshold at work where I've recognized the need to draw some boundaries. There definately isn't enough of me to fill every role that others hope me to.
