On Friday we went to a proper speakeasy, which involved calling ahead and waiting on a corner until no neighbors were watching before being secreted away into a bar hidden far from view of the street. There were only 4 other patrons, several bottles of Dom PÃ©rignon, and too many cocktails. Saturday was lost to hangover.

Work was calmer than usual, my inbox got smaller for a change.
