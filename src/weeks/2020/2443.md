Christmas happened, but without family or friends or travel it just doesn't feel so festive. I'm glad we got a proper tree, at least.

Work is actually pleasant when I have almost no meetings and can spend time _thinking_.

I'm writing this late on Sunday because I made a second visit to the speakeasy, this time with a friend. It got exciting when the cops showed up and we all had to hide in storage area, practically outside. It's a great memory but I won't be doing that again even if I don't end up with the virus I deserve.
