Another week in isolation. Most mornings, now, we're getting up early, donning masks, and taking a 5k walk. On work days, we switch offices (Shannon's studio downstairs, the office nook upstairs) after taking an hour to lunch in the kitchen. As soon as working hours are over, I put my company MacBook out of reach and move to the sofa. All of this helps.

On Saturday we had a friend over (still keeping distance), which was our guilty social pleasure for some time. And participated in a virtual murder mystery dinner.

Publicizing [the book](https:/practical.guide/) is slowly beginning, now that it can be preordered.
