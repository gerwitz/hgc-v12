On Saturday we celebrated our 11th wedding anniversary with a very fancy dinner at [Spectrum](https://www.restaurantspectrum.com/), a reborn version of our favorite Amsterdam fine dining. It was amazing, and impressive in how well they integrated Covid measures. As a Covid-conservative I was pleased the staff all wore masks, which is a step beyond the government guidelines.

Assuming we're still living with this virus over the winter, we're going to need to find opportunites like this more often.
