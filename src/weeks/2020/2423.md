Work is getting interesting, as I try to reconcile so many competing inputs. My budget is ample, but the expectations from stakeholders even more so. The riskiest course is trying to please everyone, so I need to be very clear about what to say no to, and why.

Today (Sunday) we brunched at a terrace, where Shannon had been having lunch often when her office was open. Itâ€™s been too long since I ate out and the exceptionalism of the pleasure left me sad.
