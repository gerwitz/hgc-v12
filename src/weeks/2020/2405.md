It’s Easter, and we are now wearing masks when we venture outdoors. About half of days, we treat ourselves to a walk. But this means waking up quite early, because we want to be back before the 8:00 hour when grocery shops open only for elderly customers.

My dream of getting out for a bike ride was foiled by a [specific call to stay home](https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/10/top-cyclist-dumoulin-says-stay-home-biking-weekend).

It was a good work week, not least because it was short. I took Friday off to make the weekend 4 days and catch up on personal accounting. Now I’m playing [the original Zelda](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) and enjoying social calls.

The cherry trees on our little tuintje are in full bloom 🌸, and we won a local cupcake-decorating contest on Saturday 🧁🏆.
