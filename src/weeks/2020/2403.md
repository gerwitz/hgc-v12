Another week, same as the last one. Weâ€™ve been avoiding the morning constitutional, but are forming new morning habits with yoga and the rowing machine.

It was a busy work week, planning for the next quarter and preparing to close this current one. Still many things for me to learn the first time.

Friends and family are all well, but I worry about everyone back in the US.
