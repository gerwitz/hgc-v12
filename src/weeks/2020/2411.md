Only worked three days this week. It’s refreshing that short work weeks can mean less work, not simply less time for it.

Shannon’s been deep into Animal Crossing. I tried playing with her, but the co-op mode is pretty lame. So she talked me into playing my own game and cooperating as an ally.

So, that’s what I did with my four day weekend.
