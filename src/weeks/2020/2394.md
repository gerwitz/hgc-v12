Visited Julie on Monday and Tuesday.

Thursday we celebrated Shannon’s birthday in NOLA. 🎈

Saturday morning, we learned Julie is now “actively dying” and is being sedated. Apparently we saw the last time she was still able to tell stories.

I found temporary refuge in the coronation ball, but now I’m sitting on the homeward flight and heartbroken.
