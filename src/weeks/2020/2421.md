I went to Eindhoven and visited the office for the first time since lockdowns began. It’s all very surreal, but the travel was less stressful than I had imagined. The trains are practically empty, and the bike ride from the station to campus was an enjoyable break.

This morning (Sunday) I rode down to Ouderkerk. As ever, it is stressful only to get out of the city. I’m quite looking forward to living on the Amstel directly.
