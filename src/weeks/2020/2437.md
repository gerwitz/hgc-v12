We took the week off work to focus on taking the remaining inburgering (integration) tests. Already we know we passed the "knowledge of Dutch society" test, and are quite hopeful we passed writing and speaking.

Even without travel, a full week off in the new house felt like a holiday of sorts. I really got my head out of work and expect to be overwhelmed re-entering.
