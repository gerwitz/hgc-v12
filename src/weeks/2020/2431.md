There has been drama with house prep; the upstairs floor was not properly finished, the washing machine isn't usable, etc. But the move went smoothly on Thursday and we're making fast progress on unpacking. Already I can see how we "fit" int he new house, and after onlya few nights I feel very comfortable.

Work wrapped up fairly well so I'm really enjoying being offline for a few days.
