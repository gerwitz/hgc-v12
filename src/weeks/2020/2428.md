On Thursday we enjoyed after-work drinks on a temporary terras the Carr√© theater put in place on the river (in the Amstelsluis). Shannon's job is pretty stressful, so that's not as romantic as it sounds. More like a happy hour to unwind.

I've been handling the inheritance from Julie. Financially it will be nice but is not so much it will meaningfully affect our position. Emotionally, it's intense. It hasn't been long since we even learned of her prognosis, yet feels like ages ago thanks to the pandemic. And the distribution brings up my rather complicated relationship with my father.
