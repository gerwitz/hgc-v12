And then NYE happened, and it was also boring. There were still plenty of fireworks despite the new ban, but far fewer then I am used to and very little in the streets. But that's probably because we're in a classied neighborhood.

I'm disappointed in how much I was able to do during the quiet holiday period at work. Plenty of wrapping up loose ends, not enough creation.

2020 is over, but I'm not into the hype about it. Sure we're another day closer to the the pandemic being handled, but that won't be soon. Trump is still president and the Biden administration is not going to simply reverse the decline of America's political system. No one is taking climate change as seriously as we need to, nor is Europe really prepared for the neverending refugee crises it will spawn. Happy New Year!
