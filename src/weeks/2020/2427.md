I've nevber been accused of micromanagement, but I often catch myself doing it. Recently this has been common; I find myself suggesting what my team should do instead of focusing on a clear statement of goals. Knowing is half the battle, and all that. With every new role I have to rediscover the need to let go of details, but I hope I'm getting faster at noticing. 

At this moment I'm learning to let my program manager do their job with my support but not heavy-handed guidance.
