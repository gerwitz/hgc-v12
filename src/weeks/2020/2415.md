We went to see the house we like, and liked it. I’m not so excited as to jump at the opportunity, but it really cemented our resolve to find a nice place that won’t require as much work as improving or even maintaining the current one.

Work was exhausting this week, but productive. I feel useful and able to affect structural change, albeit at 1/3rd the pace I’d hoped.

Shannon is negotiating a full-time job. That will add some financial stability, of course, but we don’t need much. More importantly, it feels like a reasonable career step in a time where simply being employed is a privilege.
