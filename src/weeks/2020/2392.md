First real week on the new job went well. I feel optimistic about the direction I’ve inherited, the capabilities and attitudes of the people, and the future. The regular commute to Eindhoven is not a small thing but seen as a morning walk with Shannon plus 1.5 hours of focused train time plus a pleasant bike ride, seems not bad at all.

But everything is overshadowed by the news that Julie has advanced cancer. A real prognosis will take time, but it doesn’t look good and eerily mirrors Dad’s situation. I am evoking Spinoza’s concept of God to have somewhere to direct my anger.
