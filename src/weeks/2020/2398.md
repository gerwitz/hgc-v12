Weâ€™re back home and working through some intense jetlag.

Beyond Freret day, the trip was great if a bit odd. Sharing an apartment is always a bit weird for me, having never lived in dorms or having roommates. The Nyx accident and wind postponements really added an air of uncertainty to everything.

But NOLA is always a serious reset. I didnâ€™t think about work hardly at all, and was able to set aside a lot of my usual anxieties for a week. ðŸ¥‚
