On Monday I wrapped up the last of my formal duties in my old role. And while I've had a couple days to read up, I really start working in my new role next Monday. So even though only Wednesday was a holiday, this whole week felt like a decompression period.

Clearing my work inbox, de-cluttering my (too many) computers, and walking away from Pok√©mon really has been good for clarity. The loft sale actually closed on Monday, too. We still have a storage locker in Seattle, but no more real estate. No more insurance, realtors, tenants, property taxes, etc.

2020 already feels like a reboot year of sorts.
