Another week in COVID-19 quarantine.[^quarantine] I might be missing my train commutes to Eindhoven, soon.

[^quarantine]: It’s incorrect to refer to our isolation measures as “quarantine” but that’s the lingo these days.

Work is fine. The end of my first quarter was a big milestone, I feel a transition from “onboarding” to “responsible” and am glad for it.

This weekend was beautiful, leading to serious concerns that citizens would be unable to resist going out and creating fertile ground for the virus. Reports are mixed about how well everyone behaved, but our eagerness to fall on the responsible side of normal means we stayed home. Maybe next weekend I will indulge in a bike ride, looking for a path out of the city that avoids crowds.
