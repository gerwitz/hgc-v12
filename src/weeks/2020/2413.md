It felt like a breakthrough week at work, really getting to think about strategy instead of only basic program hygiene. It’s been fine and I have no serious complaints, but it is better to see this glimpse of the job I hoped to get to.

The outrage after George Floyd seems to have found some kindling that Michael Brown and Eric Garner hadn’t quite ignited. Maybe it’s the pandemic, maybe it’s 3 years of tinpot facism. I’m worried for public health but heartened by the passion for social justice. Watching from abroad remains surreal.

On Monday, we enjoyed a taste of normal, starting with a reservation at the Rijksmuseum. It was an incredible treat to be there with no crowd. Later we visited our favorite bar, but with inhibitions loosened weren’t as careful as we’d like. Even though risks in this city are very low right now, we won’t be repeating that soon.
