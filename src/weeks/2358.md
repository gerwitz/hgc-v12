We sold the Seattle house! It’s not as bittersweet as expected; I think we had already grieved when it was being set up for sale. Turning the equity into money that must be managed comes with some small stresses, but this is far outweighed by the reduction in monthly cash outflow.

Work continues to teach me patience. This week a clearer idea of what I would like to take responsiblity for has come into focus, but it will take time to see if this is realistic.

Being in management of an organization of this scale has helped me see that the sharp distinction between “generalist” and “manager” is not visible to everyone. I should write about that.

Shannon and I got assessed for out proficiency in Dutch. I came in at the top of A1 or bottom of A2, her at the top of A2 or better. This is not a surprise nor only a matter of aptitude. She started off our studies with more dedication and the benefits have compounded with time. Nonetheless, I’m happy to feel any progress at all and believe I can pass at least some of the integration tests this year.
