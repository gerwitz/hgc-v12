I got my first Pfizer vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 on Friday! My arm became sore, of course, but otherwise I had no side effects.

The weather is getting a bit too warm, but it doesn’t matter; Shannon talked me into joining friends for a trip to Spain. We’ll be working from there, being responsible, etc. but it still stresses me out. I’m writing this on the plane and know objectively that this is pretty safe, yet it feels wrong.
