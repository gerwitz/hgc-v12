Anomalously open work schedule this week. Still buried under my inbox but it was refreshing to have flexibility. I took advantage by breaking up the day with some rides.

It’s gotten summer-warm. Enough to be eager for airco for better sleeping. The new house is a huge improvement in terms of keeping the lower floor cool, but the bedroom is upstairs.

I ended Friday joining work colleagues in a park before joining some of Shannon’s at her office. Much more normal than I’m used to. Not surprisingly, I need to build up slowly to socializing because this left me with an introvert hangover.
