The week started with a quarterly planning event, which basically involved extending the way my program has been operating to the entire DesignOps team. It’s gratifying to be a part of.

Shannon finally recovered from her flu, but now it’s hit me. I was so fatigued and uncomfortable by Thursday that I had to take the day off and couldn’t even read. I took an LFT antigen test on Friday just to be sure I wouldn’t be infecting our housekeeper, so at least I know it’s not the big C. I’m feeling better now, but am certainly not “fine” as I couldn’t finish a relatively mild Rouvy workout.
