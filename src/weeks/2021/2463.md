A five-day workweek is exhausting! I’m glad I don’t have too many of those lately. 😄 I’ve been able to worry about strategic issues more than usual, and increasingly see the need to “hand off” more day-to-day concerns. _To whom_ is of course the challenge.

Today (Sunday) we held a spontaneous cocktail walk, during a break in the rain, with some friends. We visited a few bars throughout the center and over-indulged enough this is hard to write. Good times that give me hope nicer weather can save my mental health.
