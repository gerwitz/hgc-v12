First "normal" week of work as everyone returned from holidays. I had much more time to focus than usual, still.

Of course the storming of the US Capitol has been quite a distraction. I'm more glued to Twitter than I'd like, and have written several half-posts that I may or may not ever finish. I wish I could just let go and not worry about the US as I learned to stop worrying about historic preservation in St. Louis, or transportation policy in Seattle. Distance should temper passion, but this is too big to ignore.

The Dutch failure to plan vaccination doesn't make focusing locally much more enjoyable.
