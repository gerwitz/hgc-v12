We had a three-day preview of summer, and I was able to get out on the road for quick rides on both Tuesday and Wednesday. I needed this badly; it both feels normal and reconnects me with this city I love. Even the overcrowded parts, such as where I had no choice but to shoulder-check a young woman with big anti-social headphones.[^headphones]

[^headphones]: I appreciate the purpose they serve for women who want to avoid engagement. This particular person, though, was with friends, obviously high, and in a virtual festival crowd.

On Friday I went to the office, which is surreal, empty, and restricted. Still, it was also a taste of normalcy and I got to chat with colleagues _in person_ and share whisky. Then walked from my office to Shannonâ€™s to briefly meet with her coworkers.

I felt quite recharged, though that has been a bit nullified by a plunge back to shit winter weather.
