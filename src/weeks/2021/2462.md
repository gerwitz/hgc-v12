This week was calm at work, and I took a holiday on Wednesday. The weather has remained wintery but weâ€™re both still really engaged with Rouvy and getting even more exercise than summer-typical.

Tuesday was the day of _herdenking_ (remembrance) which is less dramatic thanks to lockdown but still an amazing moment that highlights how different Dutch culture is. There is a bit of a paradox in how much I feel like an alien yet also committed to and proud of this society.
