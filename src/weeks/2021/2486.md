We held our first house party on Saturday. It went well, though we had only about 20 guests to witness me in a dress. The house can definitely support much larger parties, and we ordered way too much food and will be enjoying leftovers for a few days.

I feel “back” at work, and feel like I’m in a liminal space between annual planning being complete and formal approval that doesn’t seem to actually happen.
