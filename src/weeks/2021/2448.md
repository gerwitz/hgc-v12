Shannon's work is stressful, but she's handling it gracefully. I think it helps that her [BATNA](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/batna/translate-your-batna-to-the-current-deal/) is simply resigning, since we don't need both of us to work. I hope it doesn't come to that, though, because except for one toxic problem she enjoys her job and from here it seems pretty awesome.

I really want to be writing more, and I have time to. Why can't I motivate myself to?
