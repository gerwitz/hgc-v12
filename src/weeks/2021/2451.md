Meh. Another week of lockdown. I did sneak by Shannon’s office for drinks with a small group. On Sunday we did a “food tour” that was a guided 8km walk between restaurants serving small portions. It was surprisingly well produced and the food was quite nice. We need more of this.

It seems my stepfather will not be be getting vaccinated, on doctor’s advice. I wasn’t expecting this, and it sounds like my mother also won’t. If we’re vaccinated, I suppose it shouldn’t matter … but until the science is more refined on that front it doesn’t seem safe to plan a visit this year.
