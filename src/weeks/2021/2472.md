I got my second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 on Friday. On Saturday and Sunday I felt slightly fatigued and generally off-balance. Saturday night I slept very poorly, and my temperature measures almost 1° higher than usual. Not major side effects, for sure, just enough to be certain something is happening.

On Sunday we just enjoyed dinner with friends at Mediamatic, catching the last night of the [greenhouses dining](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/07/world/dutch-restaurant-reopen-greenhouse-trnd/index.html) that got so much attention.

Work has felt very busy as everyone prepares to be gone for summer holidays. Thinking on the side, though, I’m coming to some conclusions about where to take things next year. I wouldn’t say I’m optimistic, but I can see forward again.
