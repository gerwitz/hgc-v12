On Tuesday the huisarts called and said I may never know for sure, but I should take another test just to ensure I’m not a covid carrier. I did another LFT test, again negative.

Work we super busy at the start of the week, making up for meetings missed in the two days I took off while sick. But then everyone’s holidays started and now I have time to catch up and get some writing done.

I took holiday on Friday and walked to the bike shop to see the frame and select parts for my new racing bike. Even though we can easily afford it (it costs less than 4 months of savings) I naturally have some discomfort with indulging myself so much.

We got Shannon a mixer and she’s been making cookies all week. I am unable to control myself.
