This Rouvy thing is fun! Shannon and I are both using it often (4 times this week for her, 3 for me because I rode outdoors on Saturday). Let’s hope this continues because I need to work on the BMI.

I have a noticeable gut. Not that anyone else can observe, but it has passed the threshold where I cannot ignore it. Men with large beer bellies have always made me wonder “didn’t they notice that happening?” I’ve noticed, and it must not continue.

It was a rewarding work week. I feel inspired but still frustrated that I don’t have attention or resources to spare towards what I’d like to try.
