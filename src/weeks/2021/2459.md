Iâ€™m getting worried about friends in India. ðŸ˜ž

I went to the office on Wednesday. All the rules makes me feel safer but not comfortable. We have to worry about which way we walk, remember to put on a mask whenever we move anywhere, and anyway there are still rooms that are too small for me to believe they are safe without noticeable ventilation. Still, it was nice to interact with humans.

On Friday I joined a friend (who has recovered from COVID-19) for a walk to pick up cocktails and then to enjoy them from our roof terrace. More normalcy! Despite being within guidelines, it feels like cheating.
