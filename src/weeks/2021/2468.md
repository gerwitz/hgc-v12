A week on the sun coast of Spain has been pretty nice. Sharing an AirBnB condo with Abdul and Aahd is easy and we’re always able to dine outdoors.

Working from here has been pretty normal, though I have to tether with 4G for reliable video calls. This was a big quarter-planning week and I really feel like I can trust the team to run without my meddling. The flip side of this is that I feel a bit out of control at times, but I’d rather be figuring out how to direct and influence than worrying about productivity.

Meanwhile, our org transformation program is slow going and generating drama, but I think in a healthy way. I think I’m glad I joined in time to be a part of the chaos.
