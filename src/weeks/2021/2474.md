My vaccination is at full efficacy now, I celebrated by going out for drinks with Dylan. Still outdoors. I think I was expecting to feel more unchained than I do.

I’m in a bad place regarding my job. Managing upward is exhausting, since “upward” is complex and full of internal politics. But at least the summer holiday season means I’ve had time to step back and think about positioning my program team for next year.
