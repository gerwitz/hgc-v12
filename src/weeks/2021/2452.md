Work is going better for Shannon, with more "allies" who care about the product over their own egos. I'm having more focus time, so finally refining many thoughts into concrete direction.

On Saturday night we [broke the law](/2021/03/07/covid-ungoverned.html) by visiting friends. We picked up a dangerous haul of bottled cocktails from Bar Oldenhof on the way, ate and drank and were merry in VR. More good times that felt refreshingly normal.

Still, the birthday blahs are strong. I've grown to believe that growing up with extroverts and narcissists meant that either the attention was on someone else or I was put on stage as the center of attention. I need to learn to appreciate that others can be simply _attentive_.
