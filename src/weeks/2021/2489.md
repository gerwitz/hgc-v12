Back to working from home most of the time. This week was unusually relaxed; I had at least 4 hours to work without a videoconference camera pointed at me.

Shannon has come down with the flu, which is ruthless this year, so this weekend has been about tending to that. Iâ€™m hoping the flu shot I got just over a week ago is protective.
