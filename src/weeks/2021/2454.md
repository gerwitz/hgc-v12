I do not enjoy birthdays. Maybe because I fear aging, of course, but I never really have. I suspect I have a deep-rooted distaste for the expectations that came from being raised in a family of extroversion and narcissism. I rarely found myself in the middle ground between being ignored and being embarrassingly the center of attention.
