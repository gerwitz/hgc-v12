It’s been a treat to work without a camera on me. Even if the “work” is mostly catching up on boring tasks.

For locked-down NYE, we stayed at a local hotel. It was nice, especially since the room service was top-notch.

I still don’t feel 100% and sometimes have a cough. Maybe I have Long Counterfeit Covid.
