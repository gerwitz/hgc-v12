Our “return to normal” holiday began on Wednesday. It’s difficult to completely let go of work because expected closure on 2022 budget wasn’t reached. Otherwise most strings were tied off, though, so I’m finding some remove already.

Seattle is bringing a surprising host of memories to the surface of my consciousness. The best are triggered by a return to Fancy to have one of Shannon’s wedding rings re-set with a replacement sapphire [^fancy]. The most bittersweet by the corner where we first moved on arrival from St. Louis, where I remember a sense of winning at life that I’ve not known since. I guess there’s no reclaiming naïveté.

[^fancy]: We also found a beautiful set of earrings and had great conversation with Sally, who alerted us to a protest for women’s reproductive rights. (Fuck Texas.)
