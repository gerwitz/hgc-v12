I can’t believe the Dutch government continues to handle than pandemic so badly. Now we’re back to restrictions that could have been avoided with more sensible measures and more aggressive vaccination of children and booster shots. At least we’re not calling it an “intelligent lockdown” this time.

Friday was spent in Eindhoven enjoying what turned out to be the last day of GLOW. This was part of a team event a colleague arranged, centered on a food tour of town. Goed idee!

Otherwise it was a normal, busy workweek.
