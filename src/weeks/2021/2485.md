It’s good to be home. Just hearing Dutch spoken in the airport was comforting.

The jet lag is intense, of course. Every time, I think it seems worse than usual. The surprisingly short days can’t be helping.

Re-entry to work is overwhelming because of the volume, but two days in I believe things went well in my absence yet everyone is happy to see me return. That seems pretty ideal, I guess.
