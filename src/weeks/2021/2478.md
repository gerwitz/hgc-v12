The night train to Munich was nice; I can see doing more trips this way in this age of flygskam. Our celebratory dinner at a Michelin-starred vegetarian restaurant and two nights at the posh Mandarin Oriental hotel was the luxury experience I hoped. Unfortunately, I have a resistance to such extravagance. I can’t stop thinking about how the cost of this one dining event would have once covered my living expenses for approximately six months.

Generally, I don’t feel “rich” since there is so much more wealth around me. Times like this, though, I am haunted by the thought that my former self would be disgusted at my own accumulation.
