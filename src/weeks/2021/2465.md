The big news is that I’m registered for vaccinations. I will be fully antibodied by August 1, so can start making plans to return to normal life. I’ve never felt so fortunate to make a dentist appointment.

Lots of riding outdoors this week, including mid-day on Wednesday which I took off to burn expiring holiday time. The new Abcoude route is growing on me.

Work is at a nice balance (not too stressful, not boring) lately.
