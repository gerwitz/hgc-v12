It was a week of memento mori. One of Shannon’s colleagues had a heart attack (he appears to be fine), her grandmother has returned to the hospital, and a friend-of-friends in our Seattle circle died, too young, of cancer. The government’s foolhardy rush to behave as if the pandemic is over has predictably deepened the crisis and makes freedom from worry seem ever distant. It has deepened my melancholy and I am restless at night with fears of dying alone.

But, work goes on. I gave a lot of presentations this week in very different contexts. It was helpful in forcing me to assemble common points and start organizing my stories.
