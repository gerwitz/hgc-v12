I found work depressing this week, but can’t pin down why. Friday, though, was monthly demo day. This is without doubt my favorite moment. Interacting with the team in the context of their work gives me energy and, I hope, gives me opportunities to be useful to them. Of course there are disappointments, but I can always count on demo day to restore my hope.

On Saturday we did a cocktail walk with friends and indulged in time indoors at Little White Bird. It was great but uncomfortable. Sure, the government says this is all fine, but that’s nonsense and I know the risk is too high for bars to be open.
