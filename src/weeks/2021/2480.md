We had air conditioning installed, so summer is officially over.

The wound from my wisdom tooth became infected, and on Wednesday I was in pretty serious pain and didn't work much. On Thursday it was already improving, and the dentist took a look and confirmed I had a serious infection but was already on the downside. There wasn’t much to do but take ibuprofin and hope it doesn’t recur. So far, so good.

On Saturday we visited a bike shop and I got sized for a new frame. Shannon has talked me into the Specialized Aethos, which will be a ridiculous indulgence.
