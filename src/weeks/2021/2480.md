I had my first wisdom tooth removal on Wednesday. It did not go well, a bit of my jaw (i.e. skull) came with it and tore up the tissue. Thursday I waw extremely uncomfortable and talking for long was painful. Over the weekend it has improved, but this certainly didn't turn out to be the low-drama experience my dentist said "most cases" are.

The DLS program continues to run fairly well. Planning for broader org change is a risk to the current peace, but of course any disruption brings opportunities and I'm feeling optimistic.
