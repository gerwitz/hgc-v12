I have counterfeit covid. Last weekâ€™s flu turned into a sore throat and unusual cough, and then on Tuesday I suddenly lost my send of smell and started having shortness of breath which felt like breathing oxygen-deprived air.

Despite that negative test on Friday, it sure sounds like covid! So I took a long walk to take a proper PCR test on Tuesday, which really fatigued me. On Wednesday I was useless and took an absence from work to restlessly rest. And I learned that test was negative. Now I am much improved by my throat is seriously swollen so fast breathing or swallowing is painful.

Whatever it is, it sucks.
