I took a job interview for the first time in quite a while this week. I don’t feel confident it would lead to an offer, but it’s good to keep connected to the world. The position is a really good match (if I do say so myself) so it has been a bit energizing. Ironically, perhaps, that energy has contributed to some new focus in the day job.

Saturday ended at a club, outdoors, with a crowded dancefloor, unmasked. I’m fully vaxxed, Shannon’s close enough, and we’re not traveling for the next two weeks. The city’s vaccination rate is high and the local population is young and healthy. It’s time to accept some risks.
