Pretty quiet workweek, I got the chance to actually focus and prepare material for planning next year. I really need to figure out how to reduce my meeting load so I can enjoy this sort of productivity more often.

Shannon is recovering but was quite sick even into this week. Thankfully my influenza vax did the trick.
