Work is frustrating, because it’s budget season. I’m not particularly concerned about my priorities being underrepresented, but the whole process is chaotic and creates needless uncertainty. I spent way too much of my energy in discussions that could be avoided with either a more robust objectives process, or at least more leadership that understood software experience design.

it was even worse last year, and there is also the meta-discussion that brings some hope this will improve. Slowly. Year by year.

We also heard that Shannon’s grandmother Betty is not doing well and that we should expect her end is near. We’re looking forward to seeing her in only a couple of weeks, and are no worried whether that will be soon enough.
