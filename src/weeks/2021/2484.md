Our last night in Seattle we happened across an old colleague in a bar, which was quite a pleasant surprise. I am terrible at staying connected to people, but still the lightweight friendships really make Seattle feel like home.

Chicago was enjoyable, Edwardsville and St. Louis are statically familiar. Skipping Pontiac because Shannon’s grandmother died just too soon for our visit really brings a melancholy, but she really wouldn’t want us to dwell too much.

I received news of an inevitable shakeup at work in the management level above me. I feel naturally ambitious but also am struggling with “when is it _enough_?”
