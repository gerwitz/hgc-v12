New Orleans is always fun. I'm not sure my liver can take much more, but I feel the temptation to find less time-demanding work and just hang out in this city. I know, though, that summer would cure me of this.

It's also thought-provoking. Every time I'm here, I have trouble sleeping because my head is spinning with thoughts about my priorities and sources of happiness.
