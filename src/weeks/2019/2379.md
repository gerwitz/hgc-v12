We passed the first exam. ðŸŽ‰

Fog is recovering nicely.

Weâ€™re in the midst of our periodic purge-and-reorganize at home. It means everything is a mess, but will be neat and tidy for another few months soon. Itâ€™s very good that Shannon and I are both a bit obsessive about a neat house. We both get annoyed over little differences in our tolerance for clutter, I imagine stress would be high if either of us wasâ€¦more like the rest of my family.

I have finally kicked off some more strategic work at the office. I wish it hadnâ€™t taken me a year to get bold enough to simply declare workstreams with other teams. Considering how much basic work Iâ€™ve had, I guess I should be content to have gotten here at all.

Future opportunities are multiplying, so my confidence is generally higher.
