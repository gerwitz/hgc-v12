It was a busy, productive week at work. Not necessarily towards clarity in what opportunities lie before me, yet.

Fall is really here, as the rain is persistent and the oliebollen stand has moved onto one of our bridges.

On Saturday, we moved Shannonâ€™s office from Spaces to home. It went perfectly but was physically exhausting. So I spent today as an [asshole goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_Goose_Game).
