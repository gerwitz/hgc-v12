Riding in the Krewe of Freret was amazing. The experience of throwing to the crowd is so much more intense and social than I imagined.

I expected the first weekend of Mardi Gras to be more…quaint. I may have had too much rum and don’t remember how I got this calf strain that has me limping. It’s much easier to walk now that I have a compression wrap on it. Which is good, because Mardi Gras picks up in earnest this afternoon.

We spent two nights in Florida visiting mom, who rented a nice condo on Sanibel Island for our visit. This let us avoid traffic and instead enjoy the beach. I’m glad we went for this short visit.
