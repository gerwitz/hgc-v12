I spent today working from home, mostly to catch up on the inbox and jet lag.

Kurt came to New Orleans to visit us for the culmination of Mardi Gras, and we got a nice mix of experiences. We saw big parades from the private stands, the streets of uptown, and the giant Orpheus party. On Mardi Gras day, we spent most of the morning in Bywater enjoying the hipster march before braving the Quarter.

The rest of the week has been travel and recovery.
