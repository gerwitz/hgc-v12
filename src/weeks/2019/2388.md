Eindelijk. _(Finally.)_

This week I informed my team that I’m leaving my current role at the end of the month. The secret has been indescribably weighty. Now I can enjoy the idea of the next one. This started with a dinner party on Thursday, and I feel pretty good about the group of people I’ll be joining.

I should spend some time reflecting on the past, first. Hopefully there will be a few blog posts in the next couple of weeks.

Shannon spent the weekend baking cookies. Even with a year between iterations, the result is impressive and suggests she could give up all this art and design stuff for a career in baking.
