The big news this week is that Shannon and I took the first of the Dutch integration exams. This was the one I expect to be easiest for me: reading comprehension. Results may take many weeks, but I am optimistic.

Winter seems to be starting early, and the rains have caused significant leaks at home. Finding people to repair or rebuild will be a challenge.

Most dramatically, Fog was a bit ill. But we quickly got tests run and have him on medicine and a special diet, so expect he will be well.

Work continues to be a challenge of human communication and organization navigation. Not the most interesting problems to solve, but good experience for me nonetheless.
