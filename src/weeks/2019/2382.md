My relationship with work continues to be “it’s complicated” … our new department head is inspiring, and I feel like all three of the (white, Dutch, male) people above me are competent and eager for changes compatible with my own hopes. Yet after a year of being orphaned, my hindbrain seems to be hung up on the end date to my contract rather than future possibility.

Maybe learning to repress that is important to being in-house.

On Friday, I stopped work a bit early and we began Day of the Dead celebrations at 18:00. We returned home at 3:00. At no time in the intervening 9 hours did I drink any water. I spent Saturday regretting my behavior, but at least the hangover was an excuse to visit the oliebollenkraam on our block’s northern bridge.
