Shannon's show at the end of last week went quite well. The weather wasn't great for turnout, but still she spent hours discussing her work with a steady stream of guests. The weekend was quiet as we recovered from introvert hangovers.

Itâ€™s become normal that my mind is occupied with work most of the week, but this one was more emotional heavy-lifting than usual as I focused on personnel evaluations.
