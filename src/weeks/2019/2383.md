The most noteworthy event of the week was a whisky tasting at Bar Oldenhof.

Our Dutch tutor was on holiday and this was her first week back. We felt bad about not doing much homework, but it was encouraging to see that routine exposure via podcasts, Duolingo, etc. meant we didn’t degrade in her absence.

I’m happy about at least one of my three possible futures at work, but as long as I’m _talking_ rather than _doing_ it feels uncertain and does not yet add hope to my life.
