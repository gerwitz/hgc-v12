I’m writing this from an [ICE](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/trains/long-distance/ice-ice-sprinter.shtml) back from Düsseldorf where we spent Saturday enjoying the weihnachtsmarkt (Christmas markets) with friends. I think the joy of such quick trips will be a part of European life that never grows old.

In a very different vein, planning for Mardi Gras is picking up and has me thinking about NOLA.

We have a contract (again) for sale of the loft in St. Louis. I’m not celebrating until the sale is final and disappointed to be taking such a loss versus the value in 2002, but I am quietly imagining a future without any American-based debt.
