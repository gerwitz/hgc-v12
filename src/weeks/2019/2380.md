This week we re-sorted cabinets and closets and got rid of a lot of stuff, either by selling on Marktplaats or giving to a kringloopwinkel. I feel pleasantly lighter, and more aware of how clutter stresses me. Even when it is tidy or unseen.

After almost 10 years, I have finally gotten new glasses. Multifocal, because I’ve been looking over my glasses for reading. Despite assurances that my corrected distance vision is far better than normal and my reading vision is great without correction, this makes me feel old. But they make me look younger, so I guess it’s a wash.
