Finally I have candidates making it to interviews with me. I hope this fortells team growth picking back up.

I'm glad I was in town for Koningsnacht and Koningsdag this year, the weather was delightful. Though with whatever intense flu I'm on the tail end of leading to a sinus infection, I had to dose up on sudafed to enjoy them. I was especially glad Ryan and Kelly got to enjoy Mokum in proper celebration mode.
