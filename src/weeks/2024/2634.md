We had a lovely still-celebrating-anniversary dinner by Entrepothaven. I joined Shannon in Eindhoven to show her my cycling path from the station to the Philips campus and meet up with a bunch of old colleagues. Then I saw many of them again at a house party on Peter’s roof deck. And I rode up to Marken to show Ryan the lighthouse and share the misery of “Dutch mountain” wind.

Today was atelier day, and I’m getting confident that I can produce a good number of porcelain masks for Mardi Gras when Shannon is queen. But decorating is intimidating for me.
