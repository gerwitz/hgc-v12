This week we began our semi-annual 360 review process, which is a good forcing function for management discussions. I am both totally used to talking about other humans as if they are just machines to be performance-tuned and also will never be comfortable about it.

Good week with some social but not too much, and I’ve started a group coaching thing that wasn’t yet “useful” but is already brings some “I am not alone” comfort.
