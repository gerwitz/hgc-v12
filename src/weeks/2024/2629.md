Working with the 3.5-hour time shift was exhausting. I generally “logged in” 3 hours earlier, and active calls still extending to the end of the UK’s day. So the days were long, sure, but I’ve been far less tired after longer days on hometime. Perhaps it’s because at home the late calls are fewer and more often “lean back” or perhaps the comfortable hotel room’ unfamiliarity contributed. Whatever the cause, I learned that working from afar is possible but not something I want to do regularly.

Still am glad I came, and am really happy to see Shannon feels as much affinity for India as I do.
