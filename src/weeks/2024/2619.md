Once again, two weeks straight of our “pop-up HQ” company sprints was exhausting. But less so than previously, as I don’t have such a backlog of operational issues anymore.

Here on Sunday, I got out for a solo bike ride and joined Shannon for a little afternoon cocktail festival. I now feel properly back at home. Also relieved, I’m sad to admit, to cancel our plans to attend Electromagnetic Field, which was just too much to squeeze into our schedules.
