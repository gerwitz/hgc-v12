Much attention this week has been focused on the upcoming sprint to Madrid. I _still_ feel under the weather, but am past fear of being a contagion.

But I also went by city hall and picked up my new (temporary) Dutch passport. I love that I was able to list Shannonâ€™s surname on it, as there is no gender on partner policy.
