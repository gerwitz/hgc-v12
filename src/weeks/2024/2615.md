On Monday, I attended a ceremony to become a Dutch citizen. Itâ€™s not cause for celebration, really, as I will later give it up as part of a well-known loophole that will eventually lead to me keeping both passports long term. Today, though temporarily, I have both.

The ceremony was affirming. From the chill house music playing in the city council chambers, to the positive vibe as 50ish people from around the world take turns asserting their commitment to the constitution, to the speech and video reviewing the ideals embodied within. It literally brought tears of pride to my eyes.

Work this week was overwhelming in the sort of way that challenges me to consider my priorities.
