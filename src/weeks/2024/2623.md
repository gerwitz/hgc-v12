Shannon's recovery has been sloooow. But she's been able to start work and going to the office starting Thursday. It's a bit bittersweet for me. I will miss seeing the overwhelming dedication with which she's been able to pour herself into self-driven creative endeavours. But it's also great to see her back in a leadership role and learning about her team; she really thrives when working to support others this way.

After a quiet spell, I finally have some new hires queued up. I'm pretty excited about this, but seem to be following Shannon on the route to pneumonia so everything I'm feeling is a bit tempered.
