I’m writing this Monday morning, because Sunday ended with [Alter Ego](https://www.instagram.com/alter_ego_amsterdam/) which was a fabulous way to peak a 4-day weekend. (The costumes were meh and the music was just fine, but the vibe was pretty good and the venue is a gem.) Still, the week’s peak was [De Nieuwe Winkel](/logs/dining/2024-deneiuwewinkel). 

I am still suffering the birthday malaise; it is difficult to take my usual future-oriented stance because I feel no confidence the future will come to pass.

Work defies this, with more strategic and forward-looking effort than I usually get to indulge in.
