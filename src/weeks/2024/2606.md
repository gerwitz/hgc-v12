Jet lag is real, y’all. Returning to work the same day we returned was probably a mistake, but re-entering is a much bigger challenge when everyone else kept working.

I arrived to receive a resignation from a new hire who had started the day before. This for a pretty important role and after many months of recruiting, so I’m not in great spirits.

It’s been a treat, though, to have a quiet introvert weekend and a normal atelier Sunday.
