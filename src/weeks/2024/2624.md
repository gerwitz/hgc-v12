Work has been a roller coaster of successes and awkward situations. Câ€™est la vie.

We just arrived back from Copenhagen, which was a very nice trip except for the need to fly. I do wish there was some reasonable way to get there by land or sea, Deutsche Bahn notwithstanding. Great food, and maybe the highlight was walking back to the hotel under the early morning light around 3:00 on midsummer.
