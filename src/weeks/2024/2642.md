Having the work sprint in Den Haag has been exhausting; it’s too close to stay at the hotel, but getting up early for the commute is unbearable.

But it’s gone well enough; the first week is when I’m used to uncovering problems, and every time I feel more on top of things. This feels like an inflection, with confidence in my leads allowing me a shift in focus to longer-term concerns.

On Saturday, my management team joined for a Jeroen dinner at Awful, which was awesome.
