Work is going fine, but as I approach my first anniversary I am quite dissatisfied with my progress. I mean, one could write a decent case study for me already, but it barely approaches my own expectations. I could write some of this off to “bigger challenge than I appreciated” but have to acknowledge that I’ve just not been as effective as I imagined I would be.

First week in a while that’s felt “normal”, with some socializing, a concert (Pixies), and a little drama with the atelier’s power.
