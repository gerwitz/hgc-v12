The week’s highlight was taking Wednesday afternoon to enjoy the pre-opening circus at the Carré (free tickets for neighbors) with a Dutch friend who hadn’t been since childhood. I enjoyed it much more than I expected, but also it had some of the outdated pre-woke aspects I feared.

This weekend, we have started our stay-at-home holiday. I won’t call it a “staycation” because we aren’t even planning local activities; just enjoying some focused time at home. Shannon will of course continue with her game development, and I am beginning to learn Rust and hope to get to a foundational prototype before returning to the day job.
