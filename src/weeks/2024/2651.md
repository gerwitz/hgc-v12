Operation Learn Rust is going well. It’s as hard as I feared, which is a little disappointing (shouldn’t I be smart enough to just figure this out faster?) yet also gratifying. I feel accomplished climbing the learning curve, and am glad I made time to focus on it. Already I’m past copy-pasting code and have become opinionated about libraries.

Christmas was gezellig at home with the tree and cats.
