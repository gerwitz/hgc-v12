This workweek included a lot of cross-team progress update meetings, which are well-structured and valuable, but still time-consuming. And the pace can be exhausting when you are truly paying attention to each in a rapid-fire succession of sessions.

Saturday was Shannon’s birthday party, which was an epic affair. Dinner at the restaurant downstairs followed by a house party with several zones, all of which were successful with a large crowd of good people. I’m exhausted, yet we travel to New Orleans next week.
