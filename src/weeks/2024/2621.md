Work post-sprint is always a little chaotic. I need to plan reentry more deliberately for myself and others.

It’s a long weekend and the weather’s nice. Unfortunately, it’s Shannon’s turn with the flu I was rocking for weeks, so I ride alone.

On Friday I visited the Huisarts and had a surprisingly good experience. The GP was attentive, not condescending, and reactive. I had a realization about a disconnect between Dutch and American culture, when I noticed her wearing an “I don’t understand” expression. It means only that, but to my American sensibilities is has much more “you don’t make sense” overtones.
