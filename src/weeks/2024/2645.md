It was an uneventful week until Friday, when I underwent [septoplasty](/logs/events/2024-septoplasty/) to, hopefully, address my problems with recurrent sinus infections.

Awaking from the anesthesia, I had a highly unusual sense of calm. Besides feeling at peace in general, I was amazed at how simple it all had seemed. It left me optimistic about healthcare.

Then, over the weekend, that has certainly worn off. First there was the flood of mucus and blood, and now Iâ€™m dealing with inflammation and headaches that have me wanting to tear my face off.
