Mardi Gras and revisiting New Orleans friends was, as ever, a lovely reset. But now we’re in Edwardsville, Illinois visiting family, which is a very different kind of chill. When we first arrived I experienced an unusual sort of familiar comfort (I wouldn’t call it nostalgia), but that waned and now I’m mostly homesick.

The timing of our return to the St. Louis area happened to be perfect to get Apple Vision Pros[^avp], so now we have those. I’ll write about first impressions when we’re back home, but I’m both underwhelmed and bullish on the future of the product line.

[^avp]: Or is it Apple Visions Pro?
