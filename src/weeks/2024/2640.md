Our semi-annual “pop-up office” event is a week away and the preparation anxiety is ramping up. But hardly unbearable.

I don’t think that’s to blame, but my dreams have been darker than usual lately. Semi-lucid morning dreams are normal, but they’re usually not bleak. This week, they often involve me being executed by guillotine, with me dwelling on what the moments of experience must be like as my head falls into a basket. Wonder what Freud would make of that.
