Well.

I knew it was likely enough that Trump’s victory is not a surprise, but the reality of it, and the extent of his popularity, still is somehow a shock.

After waking to this news on Wednesday, our morning walk was interrupted by a meathead whose dog snarled, barked, and lunged at Shannon. When she startle-screamed, he elected not to apologize but rather to stop and begin loudly cursing at her. I stepped between them, she prepared to take a photo in case he got aggressive with me, and he then attacked her to get the phone.

She didn’t let go of it, and he wouldn’t let go of her. I could don’t pull him off so hit him with my tumbler, and he hit me so his jewelry cut my face and glasses were broken. Finally, recognizing we were in a public space, he backed off and went back to loudly cursing as he headed home.

The rest of me day included talking to the police, visiting immigration to have my photo taken, buying new glasses, and learning an important member of my team has a great opportunity elsewhere in the company.[^ur] So, yeah, Wednesday was great.

[^ur]: It’s good news for them and the company; I’m genuinely happy and stressed out about it.

This weekend, at least, was a nice one of the usual ceramics and cycling rituals.
