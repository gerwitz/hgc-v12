(I’m writing this on Tuesday, already, because we just arrived home from Rome.)

This week was off to a rough start; recovery from the surgery has taken more out of me than I anticipated, and on Wednesday I cancelled all but two meetings so I could rest. The pain killers help enough that I have not been inclined to ask for something stronger and more dangerous, but _sheesh.

On Thursday, I had the stints removed. True to the prognosis, I now feel changes more quickly; generally towards better, enough that I was up to flying to Rome. It’s been fun, and I persevere.
