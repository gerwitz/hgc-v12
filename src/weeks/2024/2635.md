Had an interview this week with a young designer who is clearly destined to be successful, but does not match us for several reasons. This is one of the hardest parts of scaling.

Saturday we had lunch with Ryan and Kelly at De Kas, and Sunday we rode almost 80 km to test our readiness for the Dam tot Dam. It was great, Iâ€™m looking forward to the ride later this month.
