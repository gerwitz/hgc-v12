On Monday, we went on a Vatican Museums tour. One of our motivations to meet friends in Rome was to catch the Raphael rooms, which we’d somehow missed on our honeymoon tour. Now I understand how that happened; tour groups shuffle through an expedited route that skips the papal apartments! This after our guide kept us for nearly an hour outside in the rain while he rambled about Michelangelo.

We were not impressed.

But, thankfully, we understood the situation in time to exit the Sistine Chapel back into the museum and speed-run the place a second time, but with a break for the Raphael Rooms.

The rest of the trip was fun, the rest of the week was ordinary. I’m disappointed at how swamped I feel after missing only three days of work. Finally, I got by the bike shop an ordered a stadsfiets.
