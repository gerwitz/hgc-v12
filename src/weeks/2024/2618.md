The sprint week felt much better than previous trips. This is the first time I feel on top of things, know who to work with, etc. Which is not to say that all is well; there remain plenty of basic improvements before I can feel like I’m really “on top” of things and focused properly on strategic development.

Shannon came along and we had some good dinners. Now we’re enjoying a break down south on the coast with some friends at their condo.
