Work is work; this week was more “work through the nascent bureaucracy” than normal but I can always find comfort in the quality of our team.

Not too social, but we did get to dine with an old colleague from [The Artificial](/projects/the-artificial/) and attend a friend’s housewarming party. He found a great place, which is certainly something to celebrate in Amsterdam.

Shannon started a consulting gig, but it’s pretty tactical. Thankfully, that’s short-term and has really helped her refine what her ideal next steps could look like. I am really enjoying the privilege we have to carry on in the meantime.
