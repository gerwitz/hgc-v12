I’m exhausted from the sprints but energized by the team. Of course we’re not progressing towards my goals as fast as I think possible, but no longer do I feel like I’m putting out too many fires to think about them or worrying first about team cohesion.

At the moment, though, I’m mostly just glad to be properly home.
