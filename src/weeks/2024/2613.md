I’ve started to pass idle time by reviewing my Twitter archives, curating for additions to [/notes/](/notes/) and bookmarks. This is clearly going to take a very long time, and it’s interesting how many otherwise-dormant memories are triggered. (I’ve made it to 2012 so far.)

Work is a bit overwhelming this month. Not any one topic, but a little too much of everything as we head into a semiannual cycle.
