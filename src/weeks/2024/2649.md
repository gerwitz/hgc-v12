On Wednesday, we had an appointment at the police station to file the report about the assault we experienced [a month ago](/weeks/2644/). It doesn’t seem they will do much about it, except file the information in case this guy turns up again. We’d rather move on with our lives, but I am tempted to make a bigger stink of it.

Otherwise, the week was enjoyable. Wednesday we had dinner with a parasocial internet friend, on Friday we both took off work and went on a double date to a [very fancy lunch](/logs/dining/2024-librije/). On Saturday our Christmas tree was delivered and we each went out for drinks with friends.
