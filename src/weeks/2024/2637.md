This week I gave up my Dutch passport. I just can’t give up my American one while my mother still lives there, so will have to hope the laws stay stable (despite the right wing coalition that recently formed our government) and I can later arrange for dual citizenship. This was scheduled many months ago, so it surprised me that I found it so poignant when they showed me that my registration was reverted to _Amerikaans burger_.

Today we rode the Dam tot Dam Fietsclassic with Ryan. The weather was perfect and we only did the 110 km route, so I finished ready to do it again. I think all three of us are eager to do more long rides. Even if we don’t get to ride through the  IJtunnel more than once per year.
