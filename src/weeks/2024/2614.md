Almost a year in, and my weekly reflection on work finally feels productive. Specifically, I feel a sharpened focus on my need to address operational, direction, and strategic scopes. Scaling much further will definitely require some more boundaries, working against my "servent leader" stance more than I'm used to.

The weather cooperatedly beautifully for a Saturday ride with Shannon and Ryan.
