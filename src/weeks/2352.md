My attention at work is spread between teams (and staffing), relationships, processes, and strategy. I don’t feel like I have the balance quite right. I strive to mature our operational effectiveness but neglect the “soft” side of maintaining relationships and don’t set aside enough time to prepare and communicate strategy.

Shannon seems to be thriving with room to focus on her book. The Seattle house is a comedy of problems, but at least I’m confident it will sell quickly when it’s ready.
